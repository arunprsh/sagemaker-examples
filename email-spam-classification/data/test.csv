) 
) 1) What *exactly* does ""Unable to connect to honor.cloudmark.com:2703; Reason: Operation now in progress."" mean ??? I have seen this error message some 1700 times today (between 2 clustered servers) representing a little over 1% failure rate. In an enterprise level I was hoping for more along the lines of maybe one-tenth that .....  It's a network error - That string is not created by 
  Razor Agents.  Its trying to connect and having trouble.  
  1700 times seems abnormally high.  How many successful
  connections were there in the same timespan?
) 2) Related somewhat to question 1: is there (or will there be if currently not) a way of adjusting the timeout the setting for the razor-check to await a response from the server it queries? I am running this as a sendmail milter and adjusting the milter timeouts won't help if the razor-check script times out first anyway ....  The timeout is hardcoded to 15 secs.  
  No plans right now to make that an option.
  You can always edit the source - Core.pm.  :)
) 3) What are the plans for fire.cloudmark, apt.cloudmark, ubik.cloudmark?  It seems that we have all these catalogue servers yet a good portion of the time, only one is available or the last discovery ends up only listing one (currently honor.cloudmark) in the cataloge.lst file.  The system is designed so servers can be added and 
  subtracted without the clients caring - if the razor
  client can't connect to a server, it re-discovers, getting
  all currently available servers and stores results locally.
) 4) What would be the implications/requirements/caveats of hosting a catalogue server or, at the minimum, a caching server (similar to the way mail-abuse.org, for example, does dns zone transfers of its rbl list -- I realize that this is a completely different mechanism, but you get the point I am driving at here). I realize that there is an issue of polluting the catalogue but perhpas there could be some way of certifying a catalogue server? What type of bandwidth considerations are we looking at here? (It is just the signatures that are actually transferred across the pipes, is it not?)  We are looking into releasing caching catalogue servers 
  for those besides us to use.
) It really looks like there is a great potential here for a very workable tool and if I can get some of these issues addressed or can even be of some assistance, all the better .....

HiI have just installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine. I am completely new
to Linux and therefore have run into a few problems.The graphic display on my PC doesnt seem to work. My monitor is slightly
miss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes
). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2),
and shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere.Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT
Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again
it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.If anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more.
Please keep in mind I am new to it though.ThanksMark

 subject : government affairs organization announcement
 with the announcement of enron ' s acquisition by dynegy behind us , and with the initial severance process completed , it seemed an appropriate time to effect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared to meet the challenges of the future . before i turn to the organizational changes , i would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving the company as a result of the initial severance ( you ' ll know who they are by their absence on the organizational chart ) : leading and being a part of this group has been a privilege ? i am thankful for every day that i have had that responsibility and thankful for however long i continue to have the responsibility . this sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicated group of professionals and support staff and who , to a person , are also very decent and good people . to say good - bye to some of our colleagues is not easy . i want to , on behalf of all of us , thank them for their hard work , their integrity , their decency , and the good times and laughter that we shared . i trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that have been and will continue to be very special . thanks to each of you who are leaving for all you have done .
 as to the organizational structure , it has become increasingly apparent to me that the existing organization , with a mix of groups organized along functional and regional lines ( particularly within the u . s . ) , has impeded our ability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times . the need to rationalize the organizational structure , in order to consolidate all u . s . energy functions , is a strong need from my perspective . as a result , jim steffes will lead the u . s . energy group along with sue nord , who will jointly report to jim and myself . sue will assist jim in the leadership of the group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to help jim shoulder a significant burden . also reporting to jim will be a leadership group for u . s . energy that will be as follows : wholesale electricity will be led by christi nicolay ; retail electricity and natural gas will be led by harry kingerski ; wholesale gas will be led by leslie lawner . last , but not least , jeff dasovich and sue mara , who will continue to focus on california energy issues , will report to jim . ( sue mara will also be part of the wholesale electricity team ) .
 steve montovano , who will continue to report to me , will lead a commercial development effort along with dan allegretti .
 with the elimination of the regional groups , i also recognize that there is a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political / legislative needs across the u . s . paul kaufman will lead a small group that will address that need and that will focus on state political support . paul will also take the lead for government affairs in support of corporate development efforts across the u . s .
 much of the rest of the group remains the same . linda robertson will continue to lead the washington group with sarah novosel , who reports to linda , taking the lead role in our coordination of activities at ferc . amr ibrahim will continue to lead the support of the global assets group and also continue to manage the risk analytics function . maggy huson will take over support of the non - energy business units , which are as follows : global markets , industrial markets , networks , and broadband . rob hemstock will continue to lead the support of enron canada . paul dawson , who heads up government affairs for europe ; sergio assad , who heads up government affairs for south america ; and mike grimes and mark crowther , who head up our asian efforts , will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself .
 i am also forming a north american leadership group for government affairs to provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company . that committee will consist of rob hemstock , maggy huson , amr ibrahim , paul kaufman , harry kingerski , leslie lawner , steve montovano , christi nicolay , sue nord , sarah novosel , linda robertson , jim steffes and myself . we will also continue to have an rcr committee that will consist of maggy huson , harry kingerski , sue nord , linda robertson , jim steffes & myself . finally , i am forming a dynegy / enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of jose bestard , paul dawson , paul kaufman , sue nord , sarah novosel and myself .
 no organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perfect or permanent . i believe these changes will make us better and more prepared for the future . however , we must be prepared to further adjust as the future unfolds for the company .
 one final note : i am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through this uncertain and troubled period for the company . we are all saddened by the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our group fundamentally altered , but we must resolve to do our best for each other and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges , for those of us who do remain a part of the new dynegy , reflects the excellence and integrity that has characterized our group . personally , i will do all i can , for as long as i can , to steer the group through this to the very best place possible . your continued dedication and support is very much appreciated . hang in there and thanks ."

 dear ,
 i am george williams , a consulting auditor , nedbank plc ,
 johannesburg - south africa . during the course of my auditing work with my client
 bank , i discovered an account worth $ 25 , 400 . 000 . 00 usd opened in the bank
 in 1998 by a great late estate magnate who died without a written or oral
 ' will ' attached to the account with respect to his investment in habitat
 real estate company south africa . [ flight af 4590 ]
 it is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any
 of late mr . andreas schranner next of kin known to the bank , according to
 the immigration data available to the bank , that the management , under the
 influence of our chairman and members of the board of directors , started arrangement
 for the fund to be decleared "" unclaimed "" and subsequentlly be donated as
 trust fund for arms / ammunition to further enhance the course of war in africa
 for their selfish political interest / investment .
 in order to avert this negative development , i have secretly discussed this
 matter with a close confidant attorney whom i must involve in order to assist
 us produce legal back - up documents which would substantiate claims / position
 of next of kin and also enable us have a smooth and successful transfer of
 the fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate . i contacted
 you to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank account for the
 transfer and also stand in as distant next of kin to the deceased .
 all validating and authenticating documents to enable you get this fund will
 be carefully worked out . we have secured from the probate
 registry , an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased
 beneficiaries , and makes this business 100 % risk free and legal . the
 sharing ratio after completion of transfer will be thus : 60 % for me ,
 35 % for you , and 5 % to cover any expenses that may be incurred in the
 course of completing the transfer .
 kindly indicate your interest to enable us , with your assistance , move the
 fund to the banks offshore clearing houses in europe or asia . please note
 that for the purposes of confidentiality , all further
 correspondence should be through my alternative email : georgew 205 @ yahoo . co . in
 accept my warm regards as i await your response .
 sincerely ,
 mr . george williams

 dan staines and joe conner focus on wholesale activities , you can work this out with rick / jim . i ' m fine with the rest .

 janet -
 1 . the best split is probably just 50 / 50 on personnel . while everyone is in a specific box on the org chart , many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles . the $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward ( for example , if ees wants something specific on a state puc matter ) .
 2 . in terms of approving outside service expenditures , i would like to sit down with you , louise , and rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals . i will try and set up some time the first week of december .
 4 . i have put steve montovano in the ne gas box . this will increase the budget by $ 400 k ( based on historical figures ) . i have attached a new org chart to represent this change .
 also , dan staines ( who is not on the org chart ) has an employment contract that ends 6 / 12 / 2002 . dan has been working on florida and northeast rto matters and continues to help east power with the nyiso tcc auction . we can sever him , but his contract will need to be paid off ( $ 87 k ) . govt affairs also has a contract for support with joe connor ( ex - southern exec ) to support our se activities . i am trying to get a copy of the contract , but i think that it is in place until 8 / 02 . my recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today .
 thanks ,
 jim

 ees is fine with the org . chart below . i understand the $ 6 . 4 million is total for both ena & ees . comments :
 1 . ) need a recommended split of the $ 6 . 4 million for ena / ees .
 2 . ) i understand the $ 6 . 4 million includes $ 0 for outside services . the ooc of ena / ees needs to approve as these services are needed .
 3 . ) the $ 6 . 4 million does include legacy real estate costs . jim fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs - is this on his radar screen ?
 4 . ) we need to reconcile what we do with steve montovano . because both ena / ees want to utilize him , i might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him . louise / jim - are you both ok with this ? if so , rick / jim , i would suggest putting him in the ne gas box .
 5 . ) rick , i understand you ' re talking with kean / whalley on handling the washington office activity in corp . i agree .

 here is the org chart that captures our discussions . i think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ena and ees .
 total headcount = 21 . the personnel cost = $ 6 . 4 mm ( total for ena and ees ) .
 please let me know if you have any questions .

1,"Subject: we have a winning track record of investment profiles gvarm u xcdsrrrr
 market watch special alert achieved record results for
 our investment alert for the first quarter of 2004 .
 our subscribers have pocketed huge gains by revealing
 unknown and undervalued gems thrust into the spotlight .
 results for our first quarter investor alert issued in
 december 2003 :
 company recommended : torvec , inc . ( tovc )
 price when recommended : 1 . 45
 highest price reached : 8 . 99 ( + 520 % )
 second quarter investment alert :
 deer park technology , inc . ( drpt )
 price : . 39
 assets : over 18 million ( 2 . 09 per share )
 est . 2004 eps : . 15 growth 300 % +
 shares out : 8 . 6 million
 float : 1 . 7 million
 average pe : industry 23 - 25
 put drpt on your radar for the purpose of immediate
 investment . merger completed with 10 - year old
 entertainment empire . name change imminent to reflect
 a treasure - trove of entertainment media properties .
 stock performance guide : drpt
 7 day trading target : 1 . 20
 30 day trading target : 2 . 50
 12 - month est . average pe x 2004 eps = 3 . 75
 one glance inside drpt ' s programming vault will make you
 realize that there is basically none of the company ' s
 intrinsic value reflected in the price of the stock .
 this is a direct result of a stock that is completely
 unknown to investors . watch how quickly prices roar when
 word spreads , investors grab their calculators , and the
 realization is clear that this stock is trading for just
 pennies on every dollar of tangible assets .
 the value of the company ' s core assets will force its way
 into the stock price , with this explosive entity stepping
 into the spotlight and evolving drpt into media classics
 international , inc . although a new name to investors , media
 classics is a major video stock footage company with
 worldwide distribution that has amassed a 3 , 000 film product
 line since 1994 .
 an overview of media classics ' holdings reveals a tremendous
 diversity of entertainment media , started from scratch about
 ten years ago that has subsequently morphed into an almost
 $ 20 million asset empire with top award winning producers
 and directors at the helm .
 the company ' s entertainment assets are comprised of over
 2 , 400 hours of stock film footage , documentary and educational
 films , over $ 8 million of animated art and programming ,
 distribution rights for 110 full - length feature films
 categorized as top box office draws starring oscar winners
 and a who ' s - who of hollywood actors , as well as sports
 programming , and music rights . this complete library is
 distributed worldwide in vhs , dvd , on cable television and
 via the internet , and is a continuing source of rapidly
 growing revenues .
 several recent news announcements are well - timed with the
 upcoming corporate name change and will add significant
 value to a growing bottom line . these releases include :
 1 . the licensing of 36 films for distribution as dvd ' s
 and home video through a group of entertainment companies .
 2 . the completion of ten ( 10 ) documentaries to be released
 within 60 days produced as a joint venture with well -
 known terramar productions .
 3 . a contract to provide entertainment products to the us
 navy for use on board ship and at navy bases around the globe .
 here are some figures that put into perspective the enormous
 potential revenues that are available to industry players
 with diverse entertainment properties . the movie industry
 generates $ 150 billion while the entire music industry
 yields $ 30 billion worldwide . video rentals in the us totaled
 $ 7 billion , video sales reached $ 10 billion , and dvd sales
 totaled $ 4 billion for a total of $ 21 billion in post - theatrical
 gross profits . with 50 % of the wholesale price of a dvd or
 vhs going to the producer or studio , it is clear to aggressive
 investors why drpt ( media classics ) has become our # 1 stock
 pick for 2004 .

Man admits Soham kidnapping hoax callsA man has admitted making hoax calls to police investigating the
disappearance of Soham schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.
Wrexham Magistrates Court, in North Wales, heard jobless Howard Youde made
three calls to police in Cambridgeshire claiming to have abducted the
youngsters.
He was arrested in Wrexham in the early hours of August 16 when officers
traced the call to a phone box on the town's Brook Street.
The 45-year-old, of Queensway, Hope, near Wrexham, has pleaded guilty to one
count of wasting police time on August 15 this year.
The court was told Youde claimed to have no recollection of making the calls
having been drinking all day.
Defence lawyer Mark Arden says the offence was neither premeditated nor
calculated but added that this was no excuse.
He said: ""What he's done is horrific. It's unforgivable. The distress he's
caused the families is unacceptable.""
Youde has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he will
be sentenced.
The hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although the
defendant has been warned custody is an option.

 lert - december 20 , 2000
 title : access on the block : international transmission auctions are opening
 european power markets
 e - mail category : cera insight
 cera knowledge area : european power
 despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among european transmission
 system operators , regulators , and the european commission in florence ,
 auctions of international transmission capacity ( itc ) in france , the united
 kingdom , denmark , belgium , italy , austria , switzerland , slovenia , and the
 netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the
 single european marketplace .
 however , the patchwork auctioning of access to itc leaves important issues
 unresolved . the most significant of these include the potential for gaming ,
 third - party transit , and the allocation of auction proceeds . as they stand ,
 these issues , cera believes , are likely to lead to action at the european
 level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated scheme .
 nevertheless , current plans to open most of europe ' s itc represent a
 watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and
 determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in 2001 .
 international auctions are opening markets
 a major portion of international transmission capacity on the continent will
 be allocated by auction in 2001 ( see table 1 ) . in cera ' s view auctions for
 itc are likely to have the greatest impact during 2001 in the following areas :
 * increasing market transparency . the posting of available transmission
 capacity on yearly , monthly , and daily bases will facilitate the market ' s
 efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity . for the first time ,
 signals for new transmission investment , power flows , and transmission asset
 valuation will come from the market .
 * increasing cross - border trade . although auctions may not reduce uncertainty
 in the marketplace initially , the effect of heightened transparency in access
 rules and prices will soon work to increase trade . secondary markets for
 interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power
 products and work to increase the overall level of trade . ?
 * increasing price correlation . auctions will replace nonmarket - based
 allocation methods such as long - term capacity reservation . the dynamic
 character of shorter - term auctions , combined with an expected secondary
 market for capacity , should bring access to international capacity in line
 with the needs of the market . in this way the market will be able to adjust
 more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate
 pricing points .
 * increasing competition . once players have secured access to itc at a given
 price , they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the
 capacity into structured deals . the result could be more aggressive
 maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike , resulting in
 greater competition at the national level .
 * reducing the competitiveness of imports . the results of international
 transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported
 power into domestic markets . final prices offered for itc will reflect the
 relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more
 expensive to import .
 * spurring investment in transmission . the money raised through auction could
 provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in
 upgrading international transmission links . access to international
 transmission capacity between the netherlands , germany , and belgium in 2001
 was auctioned for 63 million euros ( see http : / / www . tso - auction . org for
 details ) . ? auctions for access into spain , france , and italy are expected to
 realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets .
 connecting rather than integrating markets
 auctions between national grids , or more accurately commercial grids , are a
 pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international
 transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis . the auctions will
 open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission
 system operators .
 even so , the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or
 the stated objectives of european policymakers . in cera ' s view the following
 issues may eventually bring down the hammer on itc auctions :
 * third - party transit . the bilateral nature of itc auctions perpetrates the
 problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit
 through a third grid . this is ultimately inconsistent with the european
 commission ' s objective of a single european power market . the fact that
 physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always
 transit third - party grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach .
 * transaction - based scheme . although still transactional in nature ( tied to a
 specific deal ) , auctions fall within the european commission ' s stated
 preference for market - based mechanisms for allocating international
 transmission capacity . it remains to be seen how successful this approach is
 in achieving integration of national markets . action at the european level
 could move allocation of itc in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms
 such as market splitting , counter trading , or redispatching .
 * gaming of auctions . auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission
 on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most . in practice
 it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided . even though most of the
 auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity , tactical
 maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price
 of imported power .
 * allocating auction proceeds . one likely outcome of auctions will be the
 transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the
 rents currently reaped by other players . this will works to raise the value
 of transmission assets relative to generation , suppliers , or traders . it
 remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among
 transmission companies and the grid , as transmission is still currently
 subject to monopoly regulation .

1,"Subject: a great business opportunity just for you !
 
 hello ! about two months ago i received it again and , because of the catchy subject line , i finally read it . afterwards , i thought , "" ok , i give in , i ' m going to try this . i can certainly afford to invest $ 20 and , on the other hand , there 's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash . "" i promptly mailed four $ 5 bills and , after receiving the reports , paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me . after reading the reports , i also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free ! i was not prepared for the results . every day for the last six weeks , my p . o . box has been overflowing with $ 5 bills ; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and i ' ve had to upgrade to the corporate-size box ! i am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in ! my husband and i have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house . now , not only are we purchasing a house with 40 % down , we ' re going to venice , italy to celebrate ! i promise you , if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up ( and count your money ! ) , you will make at least as much money as we did . if you can open an envelope , remove the money , and send an e-mail message , then you ' re on your way to the bank . take the time to read this so you ' ll understand how easy it is . if i can do this , so can you ! = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = * * * print this now for future reference * * * the following income opportunity is one you may be interested in taking a look at . it can be started with very little investmentand the income return is tremendous ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ you are about to make at least $ 50 , 000 in less than 90 days ! please read the enclosed program . . . then read it again ! ! ! $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it ! simply follow the instructions , and your dream will come true . this multi-level e-mail order marketing program works perfectly . . . 100 % every time . e - mail is the sales tool of the future . take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising now ! ! ! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . get your piece of this action ! ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the u . s . , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incured many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . at that moment something significant happend in my life and i am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life forever financially ! ! ! in mid december , i received this program via e-mail . six month 's prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it ! but like i was saying , in december of 1995 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining the program was legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not . "" initially i sent out 10 , 000 e-mails . it cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about e-mail is that i do n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13 , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that "" you must receive 15-20 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20-90 days was done . by january 30 , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 + orders for report # 2 within 2 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19 , of my e-mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attatched program , it will change your life forever ! ! ! remember , it won't work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it won't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15-20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 + orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20-90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and are if financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the orginator of this program : by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successfull for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happend to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over 4 million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices that make this and several other programs here and over seas . by the spring we wish to market the "" internet "" by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on everyone of them ! remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now !

"" , please read this program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what you do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four ( 4 ) reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four ( 4 ) names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self-addressed stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering it from . you will need all four ( 4 ) reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with your 's , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and the address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! ! ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the requested changes in the name list , save it as text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever e-mail program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and acquiring e-mail lists . step ( 4 ) e - mail a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , e-mail to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get e-mail addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four ( 4 ) reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports : * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales "" order report # 1 from : kathy smith 5312 s . e . 30 ave ocala , fl 34480-7524 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" major corporations and multi-level sales "" order report # 2 from : micro info publishing inc . 2107 w . commonwealth ave . dept . 264 alhambra , ca 91803 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" sources for the best mailing lists "" order report # 3 from : som co . 2168 s . atlantic blvd . # 101 monterey park , ca 91754 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" evaluating multi-level sales plans "" order report # 4 from : kal inc . p . o . box 2433 glenview , il . 60025-2433 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion : i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20-90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say "" no "" than "" yes "" , and this the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that cost me pennies to produce and e-mail . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or a pyramid scam . at times you probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain lettters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four ( 4 ) financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy . best wishes with the program and good luck !

I like this idea, but from my reading - part of my dissertation research -
on GAs (or, in this case, more precisely ""Evolutionary Programming"", since
the parameters are non-binary and the major operator is mutation, not
crossover), you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are
between different variables, the better-tweaked the GA/EA will need to be,
especially to avoid local optima (which may have been the problem with the
suspiciously-high ""anti-ratware"" USER_AGENT scores). From past results,
what's needed are one or more of the below:
        A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,
           with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow
           for having ""correlated"" mutations - in other words, have a
           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at
           once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly
           in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the
           ""Evolutionary Strategies"" of Schwefel;
        B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how
           well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a
           fifth of the new ""individuals"" are doing about as well as, or
           better than, the parental generation, then mutate more
           parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well
           as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less
           parameters.        -Allen------- You are receiving this mail because: -------

0,"Hello Gary,
Uh, plague is not action.  No, no one has a problem quarantining
someone who has say, Ebola, or malaria, because diseases do not
require any decisive action -- just contact.fantasies, still require decisive action, even if its in conjunction
with the way the fantasy works in the individual's brain. Many people
have very strange and obscure fantasies (say wanting to be a model)
that dont' require them to be locked up.Fantasies aren't nearly as much like plagues.   Not everyone in a
given population necessarily adheres to that given fantasy, whereas
everyone can get a given plague.   (BTW, gary, the whole concept of
monitoring a given 'racial populaiton' for fear of them getting a
plague is silly.  I don't think plagues discriminate)You're trying to argue for a lock'em all up mentality, when I don't
think anyone but you has even mentioned it.   His point was that
fantaesies were a psychological? explanation for a possible event.
Not that all people who have them, or even have a certain type, need
to be locked up, quarantined, killed, rubbed-out or cleansed.GLM> Well, for example ..>>>>>> ""b"" == bitbitch   writes:GLM>     b> Once we understand this [ the fantasy virus model ], many of

Assuming the machines are networked, let each one send a copy of its kernel to
the others.  If the drives are open-the-box-and-switch-cables, then you can
start dd'ing a floppy before you start.  If the drives are in drawers, then this
might slow you down by all of 60 seconds.Alternatively, you could use netboot.  No, I'm serious.  Set the boot sequence
to first hard disk then network.  Do NOT make any partition on the standby
active.  Have a look at the etherboot package.  One of the things it contains is
a pascal-ish language for writing boot menus.  You can write a one-liner that
basically says ""boot /dev/hda1"" (or whatever, there's example code).  IIRC, the
resulting ""bootable image"" is a whopping 4K.  The downside is you'll need a
bootp and tftp server somewhere....hth,
Ronan.

 we have already done a number of things to help reduce aep ' s exposure to enron , none of which were required contractually . we made a margin payment of $ 50 , 000 , 000 . we arranged ring - trades with allegheny which reduced your exposure by over $ 90 , 000 , 000 . we have proposed a number of assignments which would reduce your exposure to enron incrementally .
 conversely , pursuant to our contracts aep has failed to pay a $ 1 , 311 , 625 . 46 swap settlement that was due on 11 / 8 / 01 . additionally , a margin call which was due to enron on 11 / 8 / 01 in the amount of $ 19 , 250 , 000 and remains unpaid . additionally , aep has failed to continue to trade with enron which was not our understanding of the agreement .
 enron maintains its investment grade credit rating and is receiving $ 1 . 5 billion of additional funded equity capital from dynegy as announced on friday . we are more than happy to continue helping you to reduce exposures in mutually agreeable manners but do not agree to the below list of requests . we need you to address these above issues before we can progress on these exposure reductions .

 per our conversation on november 12 , 2001 , aep has reassessed it ' s risk tolerance for enron corporation . in light of the current status , we propose the following things to be done to allow for normal trading and other business activity to commence :
 a fully executed master set off agreement ( msa ) with an adequate assurance provision and no mac clauses .
 an agreement that allows for same day margining
 cash collateral or letter of credit to bring exposure down to zero
 work towards executing an eei agreement
 hpl post closing settlement payment must be paid as agreed by both parties
 settlement of all payments due and past due
 these are the critical issues we feel must be addressed to get things back to normal . we appreciate all that has been done thusfar in working to mitigate our exposure , however , we now feel that more should be done to protect what we have at risk .
 i look forward to your reply , should you have any questions , comments or otherwise , please give me a call .

 i had the same reaction as martin volk to michael kac 's idea that linguists become linguists because they ' re superior language learners . my gut reaction was that it must be wrong , that we become linguists because we have a hard time learning language , that effortless polyglots pay no conscious attention at all to grammar or any other systems of rules . i was about to offer myself as an example when i realized that i _ am _ a pretty good language learner , but i ' ve always found the process frustrating . i hated learning languages because it seemed so dreary and inefficient until i discovered some shortcuts , namely syntax , phonology , morphology , etc . if my case is at all generalizable , then ( happily ) messrs volk and kac are both right - - we become linguists because we have some skill at language learning , but we are also the rational sort that thinks there must be a better , more efficient way to go about it ( and therefore perceive ourselves as having "" trouble "" with it ) . am i weird , or did it happen this way for other people ? let 's hear more . mark hansell asian lang . & lit . carleton college northfield , mn usa

- but how can we perceive those regularities ? - and how do we reason on the basis of that knowledge if there are no observable constraints on infererring ? - but if there are , where do they come from and how are they actually implemented mentally ? - and finally : how do we come to act rationally , that is , in accordance with what we have perceived , processed and inferred . we are interested in all ways of defining rules and in all aspects of rule following , from the definition of law , rule , regularity , similarity and analogy to logical consequence , argumentational and other inferences , statistical and linguistic rules , practical and strategic reasoning , pragmatic and praxeological activities . we expect contribution from the following research fields : game-theory , action theory , argumentation theory , cognitive science , linguistics , philosophy of language , epistemology , pragmatics , psychology and semiotics . we would be happy to include some contributions from natural sciences such as neuro-biology , physiology or brain sciences . the conference is organized in three major sections : philosophy , psychology and linguistics with six keynote lectures . then contributions of 30 minutes ( 20 for paper and 10 for discussion ) will follow . we also plan to organize a workshop at the end of each section abstracts : abstracts should be one-page ( maximum 23 lines ) specifying area of contribution and the particular aspect of rule-following to be addressed . abstracts should be sent by e-mail to : tarnay @ btk . jpte . hu or bocz @ btk . jpte . hu . hard copies of abstracts may be sent to : laszlo tarnay department of philosophy janus pannonius university , ifjusag utja 6 , h-7624 pecs , hungary important dates : deadline for submission : march 15 , 1998 notification of acceptance : march 25 , 1998 conference : april 30 - may 1 - 2 , 1998 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * for those concerned there is a follow-up philosophical colloquium : john mcdowell : mind and world - kant in analytic philosophy which discusses mcdowell 's recent book : mind and world . among would-be participants are barry allen , michael williams and robert brandon . if interested , contact prof . janos boros , dept . of philosophy , janus pannonius university . e-mail : boros @ btk . jpte . hu

With exmh getting upset by two instances running at the

I'm not sure what you mean by ""let's you and him fight"", but it is 
important to remember that England was in control of Ireland
for 300 years, and that it was only thanks to the distraction of WW I 
that the south managed to gain its independence. If you mean
splitting countries upon arbitrary lines and assigning different groups 
to opposite sides of the line, it also seems to have not worked in
India/Pakistan.
I suppose Canada, which is supposed to be a ""loose confederation"" of 2 
founding nations (French and English) can be cited as a success. The 
jury is still out, but so far only a few brief rebellions and 
referendums and such, still together after 130+ years.Owen"

 for the first update of 2002 , we bring you a case study ( first published in
 erivativesreview . com ) of how a hypothetical power distribution company was
 able to protect itself against weather - related variable earnings by the use
 of weather risk analysis and hedge transactions . this is a very interesting
 article which , although based on the concept of weather risk for an energy
 company , could be equally relevant to a huge number of industries . scroll
 down a little for the link to the full story . . .
 also , if you are or are likely to be involved in weather trading or indeed
 any form of risk management , you might like to check out what will be going
 on at our upcoming conferences , taking place in amsterdam in february . more
 details are available further down in this update . . .
 and finally , of course , all of us at eyeforenergy wish our readers a very
 happy new year and hope that it will be a prosperous and gratifying one for
 all of you !

 article : weather hedging at the hot air gas company
 ( based on a true story of weather hedging )
 the hot air gas company rises in a warm winter - based on a true story of
 weather hedging . . .
 the hot air gas company ( hagc ) distributes gas to homes and commercial sites
 in canada , just across the border from the us city of frozen falls . in these
 northern latitudes , the normally cold winters generate strong sales for the
 company . however , the company , because it has weather sensitive revenue , has
 a natural "" weather bet "" . through the warm winters of 1997 - 1998 , 1998 - 1999
 and 1999 - 2000 for example , the company struggled against declining sales and
 weak revenues , and lost the bet . the winter of 2000 - 2001 was different : it
 was so much colder than the long - term average of weather , that the company ' s
 revenue was quite good - that is , the company won the bet . . . .

 louise ,
 the design members will get a room for some of tonight and the entire day tomorrow and work through to get it down on paper , but it will be a best estimate by the time they finish and not completely definative , as that can only really happen at the end of an elaboration / design phase . . . . there is no way that they could commit to a design decision for these big - ticket items in such a short space of time without compromising the quality of those decisions .
 i believe you can get a draft on you desk by the end of tomorrow , but can ' t guarantee that it can be reviewed in that time and signed , unless we acknowledge that this is an inception document and not an elaboration document . ( an inception document states intent to kick off the project , while an elaboration document fleshes out the details and a design is produced ) .
 the team are trying hard to accomodate this request and i hope you will understand if they don ' t quite make it by eob friday .

 hi louise ,
 i tried to call a moment ago , but unfortunately you were engaged in a meeting .
 i wanted to let you know that the message from you below has caused some concern with my team , as they are struggling to see how they can accomplish this to your satisfaction by end of this week , and geoff storey himself was wondering how we could even get to transport valuation in erms in that time frame .
 they are heading for a draft by the end of the week , but feel extremely uncomfortable about committing to timing and full scope untill they have had more time to work through it .
 could you please let me know if you are expecting a signed document at the end of this week ? . . . . . . or can i let them issue a draft to be firmed up next week instead ?
 best regards
 steve

 i ' m a bit confused - i think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small . i would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following .
 single deal entry revisions
 options reports
 transport valuation in erms
 eol reporting tools ( possible )
 i would like to see phase ii include the items above and an inception document re - issued this week .

Looks like HP is using the DMCA to prevent full disclosure of
security vulnerablities. This is not a good precedent...

Staff Writer, CNET News.com
July 30, 2002, 4:48 PM PTWASHINGTON--Hewlett Packard has found a new club to use to pound
researchers who unearth flaws in the company's software: the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act.Invoking both the controversial 1998 DMCA and computer crime laws, HP
has threatened to sue a team of researchers who publicized a
vulnerability in the company's Tru64 Unix operating system.In a letter sent on Monday, an HP vice president warned SnoSoft, a
loosely organized research collective, that it ""could be fined up to
$500,000 and imprisoned for up to five years"" for its role in
publishing information on a bug that lets an intruder take over a
Tru64 Unix system.HP's dramatic warning appears to be the first time the DMCA has been
invoked to stifle research related to computer security. Until now,
it's been used by copyright holders to pursue people who distribute
computer programs that unlock copyrighted content such as DVDs or
encrypted e-books.If HP files suit or persuades the federal government to prosecute, the
company could set a precedent that stifles research into computer
security flaws, a practice that frequently involves publishing code
that demonstrates vulnerabilities. The DMCA restricts code that ""is
primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing
protection"" of copyrighted works.On July 19, a researcher at SnoSoft posted a note to
SecurityFocus.com's popular Bugtraq mailing list with a hyperlink to a
computer program letting a Tru64 user gain full administrator
privileges. The researcher, who goes by the alias ""Phased,"" said in
the message: ""Here is the warez, nothing special, but it does the
job.""That public disclosure drew the ire of Kent Ferson, a vice president
in HP's Unix systems unit, who alleged in his letter on Monday that
the post violated the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.[...]_______________________________________________

image compression algorithm which gels more or less with the JPEG
mechanism. Since I don't quite understand how jpeg works (it's hard
math, and I'm just a dumb comp. eng.) I don't know how exactly it
matches up to JPEG. I'm more curious as to whether it covers MPEG,
because it /is/ described in the context of video streams rather than
stills, and I had a vague impression that the MPEG and JPEG
compression techniques were similar. One of the patents it references
also seems to hint at MPEG.Let's all use PNG, eh? *cough* *wheeze*Cheers,

0,"Subject: 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation
 
 invitation to become a member of the program committee for the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco-99 ) http : / / www-illigal . ge . uiuc . edu / gecco / greetings : the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco ) would like to invite recent authors of papers related to genetic and evolutionary computation ( gec ) to become members of the program committee of the gecco conference to be held on july 13-17 , 1999 in orlando , florida . as you may know , the 1999 genetic and evolutionary computation conference ( gecco ) will be a combined meeting of the eighth international conference on genetic algorithms ( icga ) and the fourth annual genetic programming conference ( gp ) in cooperation with the american association for artificial intelligence ( aaai ) , parallel problem solving from nature ( ppsn ) steering committee , the international conference on evolvable systems ( ices ) steering committee , and other organizations and conferences to be announced . gecco will be held in lieu of icga-99 and gp-99 , and as such , it combines the oldest continuously running gec conference , and the two largest gec conferences . we believe that the gecco conference in 1999 will be a unique opportunity to bring together an exceptionally large number of people from all facets of genetic and evolutionary computation . being on the program committee will involve reading , reviewing , and ranking about half a dozen submitted papers on genetic and evolutionary computation or related areas during the month of february 1999 . ( the paper submission deadline for gecco-99 is wednesday , january 27 , 1999 ) . the willingness of active contributors to help the conference in this way is absolutely critical to the success of gecco . in the past , some have complained that their point of view has been excluded from the review process . by agreeing to join us , active gec researchers will help make the gecco review process fair , open , and broadly participatory . as part of the charter establishing this conference , extraordinary steps have been taken to ensure that ( 1 ) review representation is exceptionally broad and ( 2 ) the traditions , norms , and standards of the different flavors of gec are respected . let us take a brief moment to explain how this will be done . first , the charter of the conference says that reviewers are automatically invited based on their recent contribution of a peer-reviewed publication : a person may be a reviewer for the conference if he or she is an author of at least one peer-reviewed paper in a journal , conference proceedings book , or collected book of papers published since january 1 , 1995 involving any aspect or combinations of aspects of [ genetic and ] evolutionary computation . thus , becoming a reviewer is even-handedly based on recency of peer-reviewed contribution . second , gecco explicitly recognizes and respects the different traditions of different sub-fields within gec and related disciplines . as such , the conference has established six different tracks each with its own chair / editor : 1 . evolution strategies / evolutionary programming ( es / ep ) . a . e . eiben , gusz @ wi . leidenuniv . nl 2 . genetic algorithms / classifier systems ( ga / cs ) . robert e . smith , rsmith @ btc . uwe . ac . uk 3 . genetic programming / evolvable hardware ( gp / eh ) . wolfgang banzhaf ( also proceedings editor - in - chief ) , banzhaf @ ls11 . informatik . uni-dortmund . de 4 . artificial life , adaptive behavior , and agents ( aaa ) . vasant honavar , honavar @ cs . iastate . edu 5 . dna and molecular computing ( dna / mc ) . max h . garzon , mgarzon @ memphis . edu 6 . real - world applications ( rwa ) . mark jakiela , mjj @ mecf . wustl . edu these separate "" demes "" will establish separate rules and standards for paper acceptance based on the practices within the sub-discipline . in this way , we hope to more closely group "" birds of a feather "" and thereby avoid the rejection of high quality papers by reviewers who are less than familiar with the standards that should apply to a particular kind of paper . with this kind of carefully constructed process , we believe that a large number of recent gec authors will choose to join the program committee . if you are willing to be a member ( reviewer ) of the program committee , please email gecco @ aaai . org ( note : please do not use a "" reply "" command to respond to this message since dave goldberg will be out of town for most of june ) and send the following information : ( 1 ) the exact way you want your name listed , ( 2 ) the institutional affiliation you want listed with your name , ( 3 ) your physical mailing address , ( 4 ) your phone number ( for courier address labels ) , ( 5 ) your preferred e-mail address , ( 6 ) which of the six committees you would like to join ( gp / eh , ga / cs , or es / ep , aaa , dna / mc , or rwa ) , and if you have a preference for one of the sub-categories within that committee ( gp and / or eh , ga and / or cs , es and / or ep , alife and / or adaptive behavior and / or agents , dna and / or mc ) . ( 7 ) the title , date , and publication name of a peer-reviewed gec or related paper ( published after january 1 , 1995 ) that qualifies you as a member of the gecco committee ( a complete citation is unnecessary ) . authors who choose to join the gecco program committee will be acknowledged in the conference proceedings as well as in various editions of the calls for papers , the conference brochure , and advertising . physical copies of the papers will be sent to reviewers by ups courier service in late january 1999 , and the review form will be sent by e-mail . reviewers will be given several weeks to read and review the papers . reviews are returned by e-mail directly to the aaai . the reviewer 's name is removed from the message by the aaai before the review is forwarded to the chair of the appropriate track and ( eventually ) the submitting author . if a reviewer 's physical mailing address or e-mail address changes between now and february 1999 , the conference office ( gecco @ aaai . org ) should be notified as soon as possible . although the conference is over a year away , we already have an outstanding lineup of chairs , editors , senior members , and tutorial speakers ( see http : / / www-illigal . ge . uiuc . edu / gecco / ) . the editors / chairs have already been mentioned , but among those joining us as senior committee members are thomas baeck , hans - georg beyer , michael conrad , ingo rechenberg , guenter rudolph , bir bhanu , bill p . buckles , runwei cheng , marco colombetti , herbert dawid , marco dorigo , emanuel falkenauer , mitsuo gen , randy l . haupt , sue ellen haupt , john h . holland , kim f . man , dirk c . mattfeld , zbigniew michalewicz , melanie mitchell , k . s . tang , michael d . vose , david andre , vladan babovic , forrest h bennett iii , tobias blickle , dimitris c . dracopoulos , frank d . francone , andreas geyer - schulz , wolfgang a . halang , hitoshi iba , christian jacob , martin keane , robert e . keller , john r . koza , sam kwong , w . b . langdon , peter nordin , and moshe sipper . among those joining us for an extensive offering of tutorials are rik belew , forrest h bennett iii , lawrence davis , kalyanmoy deb , ken dejong , stephanie forrest , max garzon , tetsuya higuchi , john r . koza , w . b . langdon , jean - arcady meyer , melanie mitchell , randy c . murphy , peter nordin , i . c . parmee , guenter rudolph , hans - paul schwefel , leigh tesfatsion , michael vose , darrell whitley , and stewart wilson . other workshop and tutorial proposals as well as ideas for invited speakers and other activities may be sent to the business committee ( deg @ uiuc . edu or koza @ cs . stanford . edu ) . as active researchers ourselves , we understand that it is difficult to take time away from research for the "" administrivia "" of the reviewing process . but researchers are often the first to complain when their conferences are guided by "" political "" not "" scientific "" considerations . therefore we ask that all qualified committee candidates take this invitation very seriously , and we urge you to step up to the plate to make sure that the technical content of this conference is guided by our field 's active contributors ( qualified reviewers should send an email with the requested information above to gecco @ aaai . org ; please do not use a "" reply "" command to answer this message ) . names of reviewers who respond before july 1 , 1999 will be published in the first call for papers . moreover , we issue a special invitation to past authors to consider submitting to gecco 99 . although gecco is a new entity it is the combine of the oldest and the two largest , high-quality conferences in the field of genetic and evolutionary computation . with six separate demes for different styles of work and a participatory review process , we expect an unusually author-friendly conference . additionally , past attendance at icga and gp suggests that we should have over 600 researchers in attendance , but we will take steps to make sure that there is plenty of time for face-to - face meeting and interaction as well . in short , we believe that gecco-99 will be a special event for the community of genetic and evolutionary computation . we hope you can take the time to join us in the review process and we welcome your paper submission , but in any event we look forward to seeing you in orlando , july 13-17 , 1999 at gecco-99 . thank you , david e . goldberg ( illinois ) gecco-99 conference chair and business committee and john r . koza ( stanford ) gecco-99 business committee note : again , please do not use a "" reply "" command to answer this message . instead , respond to gecco @ aaai . org for fastest handling .

0,"Subject: the comparative method and syntactic reconstruction
 
 the ongoing discussion in the list about the comparative method has raised questions about its applicability to syntactic reconstruction . i have the impression that with increasing frequency , one comes across statements such as the following in the literature : "" most of the attested languages in language family x have some syntactic property . therefore we can assume that proto - x had this property . "" or "" of all the languages in family y , only language ( a ) has some particular syntactic property . therefore we can assume that this property of ( a ) is an innovation not present in proto - y . "" in other words , there is the tacit assumption that the comparative method can be applied to syntax . but can it ? could anything resembling latin syntax be reconstructed through comparison of the syntax of the modern romance languages ? most of the modern germanic languages are svo . should we therefore reconstruct proto - germanic ( almost surely incorrectly ) as svo ? standard introductions to historical linguistics ( e . g . anttila , jeffers & lehiste , etc . ) argue that the comparative method is inapplicable to syntactic reconstruction due to the fact that there is no analog in syntax to regular sound change . oversimplifying a bit , words are composed of phonemes ; the comparative method assumes that phonemic change in one word in a particular environment will be mirrored by like changes in other words in similar environments . but what are the syntactic analogues of words and phonemes ? and furthermore , syntactic change can be fairly catyclysmic , restructuring grammars wholesale in one generation - - unlikely or impossible with phonological systems . i would be interested in hearing the opinions of others on the question of syntactic reconstruction on the basis of comparing similarities and differences ; also , i wonder if there has been discussion in the literature that has led to a change in opinion from what i took to be the standard position that the comparative method is inapplicable . fritz newmeyer fjn @ u . washington . edu

 if you ' ve been searching for a high-resolution , feature-laden digital camera that produces images with incredible levels of detail and color depth , and which has a price tag that won't break the bank , well , you ' ve probably wondered if such an unlikely animal exists . . . it does . and skytop sales has it . http : / / 207 . 13 . 239 . 101 / cgi-bin / rtr ? 91byvpm1scp9pdbo3lc0hxy5klcz3c announcing the svmini - 209 from sound vision - - a digital camera that utilizes the latest technology to deliver ultrahigh-quality images ( 2000x1600 pixels ! ) at an affordable price . never heard of sound vision ? you probably know their products . sound vision is a camera manufacturer . their customers , in most cases , are large companies who brand the cameras sound vision makes and resell them as their own . one such company , for example , is selling a sound vision camera under its own very well-known label ; that camera retails for $ 479 . ( or more . the middlemen have to make their dough , of course . ) that same camera under the original manufacturer ' s label is called the sound vision svmini - 209 . through skytop sales , it 's only $ 349 . by sacrificing the big label and eliminating the middlemen , you save eighty bucks on the identical unit . and to sweeten the deal even further , we ' ll include $ 125 worth of memory enhancements at no additional cost . to have a look at the svmini - 209 , please visit our web site by following the link below . ( and bear in mind that you ' ve probably already seen this camera , if you ' ve been doing any comparison shopping . it just had a different name , and cost more . ) http : / / 207 . 13 . 239 . 101 / cgi-bin / rtr ? 91byvpm1scp9pdbo3lc0hxy5klcz3c the most camera your money can buy . . . sound vision uses new cmos sensor technology at the heart of its svmini - 209 to deliver greatly increased resolution at a lower cost . in fact , sound vision 's cameras were the first on the market to use cmos sensors instead of the traditional ccd sensors used in other digital cameras . the benefits of cmos technology : - higher resolution - - the svmini - 209 captures huge 3 . 2 megapixel images ( that 's 2000x1600 pixels ! ) - lower cost than ccds - - get more camera for the dollar - lower power draw - - dramatically increased battery life knock-out images and accompanying sound can be stored either in camera internal memory or on removable flash memory cards , both linear and sandisk . level - selectable jpeg compression allows you to find the right balance of image quality and memory economy . ( the module which allows the svmini - 209 to use sandisk cards , called the minidisk option , normally is a separate purchase . like we said : we ' re throwing it in for free . that , and a free 2 mb sandisk card - - a combined value of $ 125 ! ) taking great photos with the svmini - 209 is effortless . in addition to the red , green , and blue color receptors common to other digital cameras , the svmini - 209 features a fourth receptor for teal , which dramatically increases possible color depth ( and , in fact , more closely mimics the capabilities of the human retina ) . a sophisticated auto-exposure algorithm prevents the over-saturation of highlights while still preserving shadow detail . an automatic electronic flash guarantees that your shots will be lit to perfection , every time . the experts know . . . byte magazine reviewed the svmini - 209 in its november ' 97 issue , and gave the camera the highest rating , five stars . byte says , "" . . . it delivers ultra-high quality digital images at a relatively bargain price .

 as far as i know , hebrew _ mazal _ ( - ) yiddish _ mazl _ ) comes close to meaning something like ` lot ' or ` fortune ' , and _ tov _ means ` good ' . thus hebrew _ mazal tov _ [ ma ' zal ' tov ] and yiddish _ mazl tov _ [ ' mazltov ] seem to have originally denoted something like "" i wish you good fortune "" or "" this is good fortune "" . as has been mentioned , it is used to express congratulations rather than a wish for the future . as has been mentioned by others , like many other yiddish words , _ mazl _ has found its way into languages that had sustained contacts with yiddish , and they may have been passed on to yet other languages . to the ones mentioned in jeff allen 's summary ( e . g . , dutch _ de mazzel _ , high german _ massel _ [ ' mas @ l ] ~ [ ' maz @ l ] ) i would like to add the high german verb _ vermasseln _ ` to spoil ' , ` to ruin ' ; e . g . , _ sie hat mir meine arbeit vermasselt _ ` she has ruined my work ' , ` she has screwed up my job ' . _ vermasseln _ is so commonly used that many will not think of it as a slang word . traditionally , borrowing from the yiddish language into the high german language is assumed to have occurred by way of underground jargons ( _ gaunersprachen _ , _ rotwelsch _ ) . i am not aware of any challenge to this generalization , but it seems rather sweeping to me . interestingly , yiddish - derived words in the low german language seem to be fewer in number and to be mostly high - german - derived ( due to a lesser degree of contact with yiddish ? ) . reinhard ( ron ) f . hahn university of washington rhahn @ u . washington . edu

0,"Hi Kragen,   This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a couple
of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will
be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the
most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix
their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and
you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you
might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.   There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very
important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes
of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available
vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated
methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about
the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into
a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you
can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so
you can make and test predictions.   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we
wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security
admin's job would be a lot harder.Adam

| Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards
| 
| On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,
| which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills
| itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash
| for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
| that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
| anyone else.
| 
| If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
| very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.
| 
| At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
| known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security
| vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
| while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
| --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
| vulnerability, if possible.  
| 
| This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
| CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible
| disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
| any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
| a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
| vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
| on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
| wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
| was.
| 
| The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
| exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible
| disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
| underground, vulnerable.
| 
| The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
| are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
| reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
| turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
| detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
| useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
| security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
| prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
| long as possible.
| 
| iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
| than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
| a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
| discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  
| 
| Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
| including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
| secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
| vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
| Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
| HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this
| extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
| information.
| 
| If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
| together, add up to a catastrophe.
| 
| First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
| the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
| I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
| syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.
| 
| Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
| become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
| --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good
| guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
| of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.
| 
| I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
| vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
| plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
| them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
| people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
| credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
| Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
| administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
| negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.
| 
| I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
| information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
| execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
| means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
| are good at networked theft may not yet exist.
| 
| There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
| Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
| than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
| Samba, for example.
| 
| Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
| motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
| interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
| personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
| a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
| increase the availability of that information to the people who can
| afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.
| 
| Let's not let that happen.

| Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program
| 
| 
| Greetings,
| 
| iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
| Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
| notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.
| 
| iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
| provides answers to some basic questions about the program:
| 
| Q. How will it work?
| A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
| security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
| of motivations, including the following:
| 
|          * Pure love of security research
|          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
|          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
|          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure
| 
| The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
| Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
| work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
| items:
| 
|          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)
|          * The amount of detail and analysis provided
|          * The potential severity level for the information shared
|          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other
|            software and hardware potentially affected
|          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs
|          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE

0,"Subject: change of control provisions
 as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million .
 many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision .
 i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry .
 thank you ."

 dealings with a related party have tarnished enron ' s ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) reputation and crushed its stock , but it looks like that case is far from unique .
 the battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities , according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing enron . moreover , enron ' s new cfo , who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related - party dealings of his predecessor , serves on 12 of these entities . and enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a houston - based related entity called es power 3 .
 the extent of enron ' s dealings with these companies , or the value of its holdings in them , couldn ' t be immediately determined . but the existence of these partnerships could feed investors ' fears that enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don ' t show up on its balance sheet . if that ' s so , the company ' s financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on wall street , where the company was long treated with kid gloves .
 enron didn ' t immediately respond to questions seeking details about es power or about the role of the chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , in the various entities . enron ' s board members couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment .
 ten long days
 enron ' s previous cfo , andrew fastow , was replaced by mcmahon wednesday after investors criticized fastow ' s role in a partnership called ljm , which had done complex hedging transactions with enron . as details of this deal and two others emerged , enron stock cratered .
 the turmoil that resulted in fastow ' s departure began two weeks ago , when enron reported third - quarter earnings that met estimates . however , the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $ 1 . 2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the ljm transactions . since then , investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities . enron stock sank 6 % friday , meaning it has lost 56 % of its value in just two weeks .

 however , enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities . the company has said nothing publicly about mcmahon ' s participation in related entities , nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in es power 3 . ( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it ' s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far , subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date , january 1999 .
 among es power 3 ' s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay , listed as a director , and mcmahon and fastow , listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors , including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan , chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn ' t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn ' t immediately returned .
 demands , demands
 rating agencies moody ' s , fitch and s & p recently put enron ' s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade , or junk , bonds , suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely .
 if enron ' s rating drops below investment grade , it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition , many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade .
 friday , the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron ' s condition .
 this week , a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however , in a friday press release , ceo lay said that enron was the "" market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . "" he added : "" it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . ""
 mcmahon reportedly objected to fastow ' s role in ljm , allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he ' s connected to don ' t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now , board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity .
 under the radar : enron ' s flickering bulb

 while the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out , it ' s clearly flickering . to date , investors aren ' t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness .
 what ' s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ' ve been imagined with any number of ne ' er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said , "" i never had to worry about enron ' s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . ""
 peter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron ' s adventures for some time . if you ' d listened to him earlier this year , you ' d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron ' s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding .
 the rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are , for now , just that . and , enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis , nor is royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and , while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess , his departure appears only indirectly related to enron ' s current woes .
 now , enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and , more importantly , its reputation .
 the company ' s challenge
 but what does enron do now ? it ' s very simple . come clean , clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets , risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks .
 "" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off , and long - term investors should hold firm , as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings , with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months , "" says jeff dietert , power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . "" we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . ""
 dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book .
 straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no .
 although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months .
 the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure .
 the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . ""
 it ' s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk , i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it ' s a tough call that requires strict , individual discipline .
 there ' s an irony to this whole story , especially in enron ' s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign , enron , looking to challenge conventional wisdom , asks the simple question , "" why ? ask why . ""
 investors are now asking . it ' s time for ken lay to answer .
 first things first
 many readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade .
 the choice was easy . i ' m with him and my family .
 enjoy your weekend with family and friends .
 dj enron unit , new england market downplay report of default
 2001 - 10 - 26 17 : 14 ( new york )
 by kristen mcnamara
 of dow jones newswires
 new york ( dow jones ) - - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its
 credit requirement in new england ' s wholesale power market this month , but the
 event was neither unique nor newsworthy , the energy company and the
 organization that developed the market ' s rules said friday .
 the operator of the region ' s wholesale power market informed enron energy
 services last week that , for the third time in 12 months , it had traded a
 greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
 risk for expulsion from new england ' s market .
 but it was administrative mixups , rather than financial problems , that
 triggered the warning , which a few other companies have also received in the
 past , the market ' s rulemaker said .
 "" i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
 participants "" that have defaulted on their credit agreements , "" and it ' s never
 been in the news , "" said david doot , secretary and general counsel for the new
 england power pool , which developed the policies governing the region ' s
 electricity market . "" my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
 proportion . ""
 news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major
 metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed
 by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s
 stock and bond prices .
 enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its
 bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem
 within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said .
 the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market ,
 to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
 person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said .
 "" clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
 ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , "" mahoney said .
 the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england
 spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its
 default .
 it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on
 occasion , foley and doot said .
 "" i won ' t say it ' s commonplace , but i won ' t say it ' s unusual for a participant
 to find itself out of compliance , "" doot said . "" those things have in fact
 happened from time to time . ""

 enron lawsuit over microsoft broadband agreement may block msn
 2001 - 10 - 26 16 : 47 ( new york )
 enron lawsuit over microsoft broadband agreement may block msn
 houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s lawsuit
 alleging microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
 could temporarily block the largest software company ' s high - speed
 internet service in some u . s . regions .
 microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
 from providing the high - speed service in areas where enron
 provides broadband access , leaving msn fully operational only in
 the 14 states where qwest communications international inc .
 operates , said bob visse , director of marketing for msn .
 enron ' s lawsuit was filed yesterday . microsoft had planned to
 offer fast internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
 give the largest software company access to potential customers in
 29 million homes . microsoft , the no . 2 u . s . internet provider , is
 making a push to win customers from aol time warner inc .
 ` ` we are trying to resolve the issues with enron as quickly
 as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
 providers , ' ' visse said .
 officials at houston - based enron , the largest energy trader ,
 did not immediately return calls for comment .
 the agreement
 enron in june signed an agreement with microsoft to provide
 bandwidth for msn internet service . under the agreement , enron
 isn ' t required to deliver operational broadband services if
 microsoft hasn ' t first provided a billing and ordering system , dow
 jones newswire reported .
 enron claims in its lawsuit that microsoft failed to deliver
 the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
 the deal , dow reported .
 enron ' s lawsuit comes after microsoft said in an oct . 23
 letter that enron will have breached the contract if it hasn ' t
 provided an operational bandwidth system by oct . 25 , allowing
 microsoft to recover damages .
 shares of redmond , washington - based microsoft fell 36 cents
 to $ 62 . 20 , while enron shares fell 95 cents to $ 15 . 40 .

 enron executives sent requests for details of affiliate profits
 2001 - 10 - 26 15 : 36 ( new york )
 enron executives sent requests for details of affiliate profits
 houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - lawyers for a shareholder
 suing enron corp . are asking executives of the largest energy
 trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
 with affiliated companies that bought and sold enron assets .
 lawyers have made the requests to president greg whalley ,
 vice chairman mark frevert and chief financial officer jeff
 mcmahon and 83 other employees arrived at enron ' s houston offices
 this week , said paul paradis , a partner in the new york law firm
 abbey gardy . requests also were sent to 17 enron partnerships such
 as whitewing management and marlin water .
 paradis represents fred greenberg , an enron shareholder who
 is suing the company ' s board for allowing former chief financial
 officer andrew fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
 least $ 35 million in cash and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder
 equity .
 the requests are aimed at determining if enron executives
 benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
 partnerships that bought and sold company assets . enron formed at
 least 18 such affiliated companies , listing executives and
 employees as officers and directors of the partnerships , according
 to texas secretary of state records .
 under texas law , failure to respond to the document requests
 will result in subpoenas being issued . subpoenas could go out next
 week if responses don ' t arrive by then , paradis said . enron
 spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to requests for comment
 about the document requests .
 the executives earned no income from the partnerships , enron
 spokesman mark palmer has said . ` ` there are no financial interests
 in the structures themselves for any enron employee , ' ' palmer
 said . he said it ' s common for a company to name its executives to
 the boards of affiliates .
 affiliates have debts
 texas records show chief executive officer kenneth lay ,
 frevert , whalley , mcmahon and dozens of other people who list
 their address as enron ' s corporate headquarters serving as
 officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
 business corporations .
 the document requests ask enron executives for information on
 any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
 affiliates , including stock grants and options . they also ask the
 executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
 affiliates .
 enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
 such as power plants and natural - gas pipelines . that allowed enron
 to move debt associated with those projects off its books .
 the affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money . they
 plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets . enron
 might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
 the debt . that could amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion if the assets
 don ' t generate any money , a remote possibility , the company has
 said .
 few answers
 investors and analysts pressed enron chief executive officer
 kenneth lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
 conference call tuesday .
 today , enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to
 questions about one of them , es power 3 llc .
 texas records list 78 enron executives and employees as
 officers , directors and managers of es power 3 llc . the entire
 enron board is also listed .

 have denied the charges repeatedly .
 next month , a california senate committee investigating the
 power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if enron and
 other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
 documents . enron has been filing documents in sacramento ,
 california .
 ` ` they are still putting documents in their depository , and i
 don ' t think they ' ve completed that process , ' ' said alexandra
 montgomery , a consultant to the committee . it ` ` remains to be
 seen ' ' whether enron is complying with its subpoena , she said .
 the suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
 california soared , leaving the state ' s two largest utilities
 insolvent . under california ' s plan to open its electricity market
 to competition , the utilities of pg & e corp . and edison
 international weren ' t allowed to pass rising costs to customers .
 ` ` i know that we ' re doing our best to comply with what the
 committee is asking for , ' ' enron spokesman mark palmer . ` ` we are
 putting documents in the depository , and we ' re looking forward to
 a speedy resolution . ' '
 shares of houston - based enron have fallen by more than half
 since oct . 16 . the company ousted andrew fastow as the chief
 financial officer wednesday amid a u . s . securities and exchange
 commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost enron $ 35
 million .
 grand jury
 enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
 civil and criminal violations by california attorney general bill
 lockyer , who convened a grand jury in june .
 lockyer has been criticized by enron officials for telling
 the wall street journal in may that he would like to put enron
 chairman kenneth lay in ` ` an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
 a tattooed dude who says ` hi my name is spike , honey . ' ' ' lockyer
 later apologized for the remark .
 the attorney general ' s investigation is proceeding , lockyer
 spokeswoman sandra michioku said . michioku said she didn ' t know
 when civil or criminal charges against enron or other power
 providers might be filed .
 ` ` our investigation is still being pursued , ' ' she said . ` ` we
 had to go to court to get enron to turn over documents , so that
 slowed things down a bit . ' '
 enron ' s palmer said he didn ' t know the status of the attorney
 general ' s investigation .
 ` ` i think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
 to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
 vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman , ' ' palmer said .
 more lawsuits
 enron , along with other major power providers such as duke
 energy corp . and dynegy inc . , face at least five lawsuits alleging
 they manipulated california energy prices in violation of
 antitrust laws .
 the cases , which include separate complaints filed by the
 city of san francisco , california lieutenant governor cruz
 bustamante and various consumers , currently are in state courts
 awaiting a coordination proceeding , said michael aguirre , a lawyer
 representing bustamante . the lawsuits should be assigned to a
 judge by the end of next month , he said .
 if the complaints succeed , the companies might be ordered to
 repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines , including
 triple damages .
 enron ' s stock fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 ,
 declining for the eighth day in a row . the shares have fallen 80
 percent in the past 12 months .

 enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 )
 ( adds investor comment in fourth paragraph . )
 houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares
 fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $ 3 billion credit
 line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low -
 interest , short - term loans .
 the company ' s stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
 after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
 enron ' s former chief financial officer . the shares fell 95 cents ,
 or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 today .
 chief executive officer kenneth lay has failed to reassure
 investors that the company ' s credit rating won ' t be cut , investors
 said . enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets ,
 where short - term loans carry lower rates than banks offer .
 ` ` do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , ' '
 said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth
 third bancorp . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of
 management . ' '
 the company will use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion
 in commercial paper it has outstanding , enron spokesman mark
 palmer said .
 bonds drop
 enron ' s 6 3 / 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2009 , declined 1
 1 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
 cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating of ` ` bbb + , ' '
 yield 9 . 53 percent .
 investors have grown concerned that the company ' s credit
 rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses
 from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash
 daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
 settle transactions .
 enron ' s decision to tap its credit line was ` ` a smart
 financial move , ' ' said stephen moore , a vice president at moody ' s
 investors service who follows the company . ` ` it took away the
 hassle and time - consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
 insured access to capital . ' '
 though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their
 yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
 that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies
 with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for
 seven years .
 a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back
 holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value
 of enron investors ' stock .
 partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron
 assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to
 the partnerships to keep related debt off its books . the
 partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
 assets .
 other liabilities
 if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money
 comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find
 the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would
 have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
 for and the amount of the debt .
 one way would be issuing common shares to exchange for enron
 preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would
 thin out the holdings of every other investor .
 of the two main bond - rating companies , moody ' s and fitch have
 enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s
 lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . egan - jones
 rating co . today lowered its rating on enron ' s debt to ` ` bb + , ' '
 one notch below investment grade , from ` ` bbb - . ' '
 enron ' s liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
 to at least $ 3 . 3 billion , the company has said .
 enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on
 wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into a
 partnership he ran that cost the company $ 35 million in direct
 losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
 partnership , reducing shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
 ` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
 the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
 benefit of himself , ' ' fifth third ' s cassady said .
 jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was
 named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , lay said in a
 statement .

 business wire
 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , business wire )
 seattle - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 26 , 2001 - - seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . is currently investigating potential erisa claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of enron ' s retirement and 401 ( k ) plans .
 the investigation period covers january 2000 through october 2001 . the investigation focuses on concerns that , under the law interpreting erisa , enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a plan investment . rather than providing complete and accurate information to the plans ' participants , it may be alleged that enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information , thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the plans . this investigation is being conducted in light of recent events .
 on oct . 16 , 2001 , enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking "" non - recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax , or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share , "" in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships , controlled by enron ' s cfo , and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market , the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition , several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading , gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets .
 if you are a member of an enron retirement plan , wish to discuss this announcement , or have information relevant to the investigation , you may contact paralegal liza catabay , or any member of our team ( britt tinglum , liza catabay , or lynn sarko ) toll free at 800 / 776 - 6044 , or via e - mail at investor @ kellerrohrback . com .
 seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade . its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars .

 fyi - attached is a complaint filed by care on april 16 against bc hydro , powerex , mirant and bpa ( with the ladwp thrown in as an unnamed respondent ) . the complaint is principally directed against bc hydro and powerex . it essentially accuses bc hydro and powerex of manipulating the reservoirs in bc and transmission capacity reserved by powerex on the bpa system to cob and nob to withhold power during a period of peak demand "" to contrive a shortage and test their market power . "" care accuses bc hydro and powerex of violating section 206 of the fpa , state and federal anti - trust laws , the civil rights of californians under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 and nafta .
 the complaint is long on sensational allegations and short on facts . the evidence proffered in the complaint consists of a rant off the yahoo message board by an unnamed power trader in spokane ( we think it is an avista trader ) , selected transmission data from the iso , the la times article of april 11 , 2001 regarding the iso ' s report on powerex , bpa and ladwp , the iso report itself , and bc hydro ' s residential rate schedule . care requests ferc to initiate an investigation , seeks unspecified refunds and punitive damages and also appears to want ferc to have the secretary of doe declare an emergency under section 202 ( c ) of the fpa and compel deliveries of electricity .
 ferc has noticed the complaint and has established may 8 as the due date for interventions and responses .

the check_local tarball includes a program called miltrassassin.
It's a C Milter program speaking the SPAMD protocol so it will be
far more efficient than spamass-milter.
Check http://www.digitalanswers.org/check_local/miltrassassin.html

0,"Subject: latest draft
 don ,
 attached is my latest effort . it entailed fairly drastic "" restructuring
 and reorganization "" of the earlier draft . my revision effort has been
 directed at improving the focus of the paper . the new story is the following :
 1 . enron was formed as a regulated gas pipeline company in the mid - eighties .
 2 . economic and competitive conditions conspired to force a dramatic
 reorganization of the company almost immediately . the result was the
 creation of a new , unregulated energy trading operation . the strategy of
 the new unit was to capitalize on business opportunities in the
 deregulation of markets that was occuring at the time ( mid - eighties until
 now ) .
 3 . the business model adopted for the new unregulated business was that of
 a "" gas bank "" . the analogy to a commercial bank posed a very difficult
 problem to enron ' s management in that there was no source of liquidity to
 the market from a central bank authority . as a consequence enron had to
 develop its own very elaborate risk management procedures .
 4 . another consequence of the new business model was that it required a
 different set of employee skills and talents . specifically , it required
 were bright , energetic and innovative individuals capable of identifying
 entrepreneurial opportunities and starting new businesses . furthermore , a
 new , flatter organizational structure entailing decentralized decision
 making was required to facilitate quick response to changing market
 conditions . to monitor and manage this new "" empowered "" labor force
 required that the firm develop new personnel policies and procedures .
 5 . three primary tools of personnel management were adopted : ( i ) measure
 performance semi - annually , ( ii ) tie compensation closely to performance ,
 and ( iii ) allow personnel free movement within enron to seek out the best
 opportunities .
 6 . other attributes of the enron model include consideration for asset
 optionality , recognition of the value of networks in adding value to
 trading platforms , and the use of mark - to - market accounting for business
 transactions as a means of ensuring transparency and promoting prompt actions .
 if my "" story line "" sounds better than the draft i have attached its because
 its the last thing i ' ve written . at any rate i look forward to hearing
 your comments and to getting this wrapped up .
 thanks and i look forward to seeing you in february .

 you may know that there is now a generative linguistics department at the university of durham ( m davenport , j emonds , sj hannahs , bd schwartz m tallerman , m young - scholten + elt specialists ) . the japanese programme is now also expanding . however , the only present lecturer of japanese is w mcclure , formal semantics ( cornell phd - - and longtime organiser of tas in japanese there ) . mcclure is presently the basis of enlarging japanese in an east asian department , which before now has focused on chinese . now , a new japanese professorship is open . a curious characteristic of the university of durham is that searches for staff members are set up to last literally for days rather than weeks . as a loyal member of the linguistics department , no further comment on this strange fact of life . nonetheless , the administration is honestly determined to hire from the best candidates - - but of course , this means everything is done in no ( or dammed little ) time . thus , an absolutely top candidate is being searched for - - within two weeks . the closing date is 2 dec . the preferred area is history , literature , politics or social studies within japanese studies . however , a good solid sociolinguist , even one with a generative component , might compare very well with whatever other candidates this brief search unearths . that is , the very brevity of the search can favour a candidate not quite in the core area being sought . in fact , not ' can ' but ' will ' - - and has , and is the key to this message . lots of publications are the main thing . moreover , durham is also a bit short on top women staff . a sociolinguistic woman professor of japanese might sit quite well as a candidate . might be a nice sideways move to get around the glass ceiling in one 's own country - - a quick move up ( what the heck if the food is n't so great , it 's damp , there 's no good showers , etc . ) . look at that list of linguists above , and consider all the linguistic events , conferences , research grants , etc . that have recently involved durham . the people above are friendly too . post begins 1 oct . 1995 or as soon as possible thereafter . send a cv , as detailed as possible , with full career history and publications and any grants awarded , and a covering letter to : mr . jack boyd , director of personnel university of durham old shire hall durham dh1 3hp uk include the names , addresses , tel . and fax numbers of 3 referees , and indicate dates in jan . and feb . when you could not be present in durham for interview . only uk residents need to send 5 copies ; all others just one . there is also a special form ( 1 page ) which mr . boyd will send you ( or a linguist at this e-mail address will fax it to you if you send us a small note as to who you are ) .

 michelle , as i mentioned in my voice mail , the other lawyers wanted a few changes . my sincerest apologies for the confusion . apparently you and i were actually working off an old version of fgt ' s letter , not the one they ultimately approved and used . since you are out of the office , i ' ve taken the liberty of forwarding it to carl without you reviewing it first , since i know we want to mail this out soon .
 carl , michelle advised me that eol ' s lawyer had approved the previous version so i assume they will want to review this one as well . let me know if there are any concerns .
 thanks !

    the account  2. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps several months after the
    user closes the account, scanned for newsletters, unsubscribed
    from them etc.  3. real spamtrap addresses to trap website crawlers.The latter 2 are the most effective, but #1 is a real PITA; it takes lots
of maintainance to avoid ham getting in there.  Some of my spamtrap data
had a few 1's contributed by ISPs, and I hadn't spent enough time sifting
for legit mail that was slipping through.  So I felt better leaving
them out for this run, apart from what I'd hand-cleaned.--j."

Date: Wed, 25 Sep 2002 12:49:48 GMTMixed news from yesterday's heart checkup. First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart 
was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive 
ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head 
with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not 
diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general 
artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they 
were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the 
heart). Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very 
well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I 
asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does 
it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really 
not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the 
ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an 
angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass 
because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part 
of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?[1] http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&safe=off&q=carotid+arteries&spell=1

Mandrake translated to Basque (and release all the changes), so that you
can just install it and the desktop and apps can be in your language. I
think that whichever organization (Irish government I suppose) is in
charge of promoting Irish here could learn a lot from them. The Basque government used to pay MS for translating Windows, but they
got pissed off because it was extremely expensive and the translations
would come out when the software was already obsolete. Now they promote
Free Software while helping the language at the same time, I think it's
a win-win situation ;).cheers,

reasoning, but it seems this is one of those philosophical questions 
that I'm on the losing end of :)The checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I 
don't really have the time to figure it out right now. After searching 
the web some more, I found out that Mandrake's version of rpm is 
patched to support what I wanted. So I guess I'll look into that when 
I get a chance.On Thu, Aug 15, 2002 at 05:14:47PM +0200, Ralf Ertzinger wrote:

not a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with 
full certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local 
use by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above 
technique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for 
everything installed on my system (including software from cvs). This 
just makes it a little bit faster.gary_______________________________________________

 hello vince ,
 i didn ' t know if that was your correct e - mail address listed below on
 receiving from outside the company , so i thought i would forward this with a
 couple of comments .
 she states below that she has enclosed a proposal , however , the only pricing
 i really see is in the software license agreement , article 2 , which states
 that the license fee is $ 100 , 000 and lists out when you must pay for it . it
 then states in article 3 that the fees are set forth in appendix 1 , but there
 are no prices in appendix 1 .
 i have reviewed the actual terms and conditions to the license and am going
 to prepare it as we usually do to send to mark holsworth for review . in the
 meantime , do you want me to go back to ms . geman and ask her for more
 detailed pricing information or do you have what you need ? also , in appendix
 2 , you will need to list the number of sites and workstations you want to
 have .
 please let me know .

0,"I call PacBell/SBC every two or three months about a recurring problem 
we have at my house:We get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our 
house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years 
and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! Sometimes the 
people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me 
that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the 
account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we 
could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the 
account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years 
and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the 
lines of ""Huh?"" or ""I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please."" And 
eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the 
account representatives and billing people and their managers and their 
managers' managers ad naseum.The outcome of every phone call is that they'll ""look into it"" and fix 
the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when 
it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked 
""Not at this address, please fsck off."" and then eventually call them 
back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to 
the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at 
them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell. 
Then I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which 
they seem all too happy to do.At least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a 
lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.Perplexed,
Elias

"" making sense "" sounds reassuringly uncontroversial , and it has taken the insights of jerome bruner in the 1960s , and of michael halliday and his associates in recent years , to bring out the richness of meaning that this expression can carry . it is now widely accepted that sense is not simply "" there "" in the world , waiting to be discovered and documented , but that it is actually created by human beings in societies . the idea that "" reality "" is "" created "" in language also implies that there must be more than one reality , and that a number of realities can be articulated and compared . these possibilities carry major implications for language education , social identity and participation - - or , less reassuringly , for educational and social exclusion . the thematic emphasis of this conference on "" creating sense "" , then , includes the essential notions that any single form of sense can also be questioned and "" unmade "" , and that alternative kinds of sense can be remade or "" re-created "" through texts . making , unmaking and remaking meanings are fundamental aspects of social and educational experience , from infancy through primary and secondary school years and beyond , continuing into adulthood and maturity . much education has to do with learning to think , talk and write about things in ways that differ from the initial "" commonsense "" knowledge or belief that children have already acquired in their communities . to bring this about without undermining what is valid and valued in children 's lives is an enormously challenging and problematic social and cultural activity . that it is also a necessary one can be argued both in terms of mainstream rationality ( the development of scientific thinking being a prime example here ) and of critical awareness , which includes learning to deconstruct powerful people 's accounts of how the world is and ought to be , and to propose alternative accounts . full participation in social and political life is only possible when people have learned , as ronald carter has put it , how to "" see through language "" . these concerns over creating , questioning and re-creating sense are explored in this conference in relation to two domains , those of language education and media studies . in the context of formal education , learners have both to discern meaning in what is offered to them and actively to make "" their own "" meanings as they interpret and analyse experience from a variety of perspectives which may be proposed to them or discovered by them . all this raises important issues of participation and exclusion relating to learners ' personal and social explorations of language , and the ways in which these two modes of exploration may be related . the conference will pursue these concerns in the broad context of language education as its first domain . the second conference domain is that of media studies , with particular attention to media discourse and reality construction . the conference seeks to bring to light some of the ways in which realities , like stories , are invented , told , represented and mediated through available technologies . diverse experiences and accounts of reality are constructed through the interplay of language and image . these can , for instance , be presented as fantasies , fictional explorations of experience , docu-dramas or documentary coverage of events , among other things . the impact of such accounts on audiences and "" the public "" depends on many social , cultural and educational factors , but the need for modern citizens to be able to make their own sense of accounts that are offered to them , and also to offer accounts of their own , increasingly appears fundamental to effective social participation as well as to social critique . the conference looks to stimulate debate that is grounded in - - - or informedly set against - - - current theories , practices and findings of teaching and research communities in language and communication studies . another main aim is to suggest guidelines for informed , responsible and reflective practice in the domains of language education and media studies . a theme of particular interest , to be developed especially in workshop mode , is that of materials writing for educational purposes in both conference domains .

100%) are all that exist in the UNIX world. Redhat of course doesnt count as
portable either, but it's nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model does
definately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to
point at in it's suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX
is just now looking at it's I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess
multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out
of it. Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned out
to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep looking till

with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that
even for the native US population, fertility had jumped in the last decade
and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but
not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile
non-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a
significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the
population would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for
being able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending,
etc.Europe did not show the same increase in fertility.Some actual data for the US are here:http://www.census.gov/population/pop-profile/2000/chap04.pdf

 subject : equity investment fair value in turkey
 vince ,
 john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting ( and
 potentially contentious ) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with
 in london . we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which
 is currently seeking to ipo . the issue we are discussing with rac is which
 discount rate ( i . e . , risk - free ? and if so turkish or us ? ) should we use to
 value these options
 first , some additional information .
 option characteristics :
 - - 116 , 000 options ( representing 9 % of the company )
 - - term : minimum of 3 years but possibly longer - - still being renegotiated
 - - strike price : 20 % below the upcoming ipo price ( either priced in us $ or
 turkish lire )
 we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $ 118 . 75
 per option but 34 , 800 expire on july 15 , 2000 with the remainder expiring on
 december 15 , 2000 . the company ' s investment bankers ( abn / amro rothchilds )
 are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at
 $ 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $ 300 million . due
 to such a large "" valuation gap "" , they originally encouraged us to exercise
 all of the options by the end of june ( ipo target date in late sept / early
 oct ) . our counter - proposal is to "" swap "" instrinsic value for time value by
 repricing the options strike higher while extending their term .
 we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to
 use to value the options . we are arguing that the us risk free is the most
 appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company ' s
 historical senior debt cost ( 18 % ) is the more appropriate number to use
 ( although admit that this is not justifiable - - only a proxy )
 a few key points :
 - - rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this "" to
 be negotiated "" discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future
 options intrinsic value in 3 years
 ( i . e . , for black - scholes , a higher discount rate yields a higher value but
 the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation )
 - - the model simulates both an ipo / no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we
 have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 % return
 - - the model assigns a 30 % illiquidity discount
 - - in the simulated cases where the options are out - of - the - money , we
 obviously do not exercise .
 we understand that for black - scholes option valuation , one needs to be able
 to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and
 the risk free in order for the valuation to hold . and here is where we reach
 our difficulty : since the company doesn ' t currently trade on a public market
 and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities , rac is arguing
 that a us risk free is not appropriate to use . our argument is that the
 non - ipo scenario , a 30 % illiquidity discount and a us $ based option
 volatility are already in the factored into the simulation . as such , we feel
 rac ' s approach is double counting .
 if you managed to get through the above , your a patient man ! i ' ll give you a
 call today or tomorrow after you ' ve had a chance to digest the information .

 there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a press costing
 from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of consumable
 products per month .
 offset presses print all types of documents ; forms , labels , tickets , tags ,
 advertisements and direct mail pieces , at production rates of 500
 pages - per - minute ( ppm ) to thousands of ppm . however , the printed materials
 produced are each identical , as each image printed is the offset inked image
 derived from the printing plates that are mounted on the offset press . the great
 limitations of the offset process are that each image ( page ) remains identical
 unless the printing plates are changed . also the inking of the plates requires
 the laborious tasks of mixing the inks for each plate , inking the plates and
 then cleaning the press for the next job . if the print job requires variable
 information , such as ; name , address , bar codes , dates , prices , this must be
 added in a distinctly separate print operation . typically this task is performed
 by expensive data processing laser printers , manufactured by either xerox , ibm
 or oce ' ( formerly , siemens printing systems ) . the laser printers print only in
 black .
 lis printing systems are designed to mount directly on most offset web presses
 and allow for the printing of any type of data or graphics , without limitation ,
 and in line with the offset presses traditional production of a colorful end
 product . as a simple example : in the production of an event ticket such as a superbowl
 ticket , all fixed or non - variable information , such as the colorful
 photo - quality front cover and the stadium rules and disclaimers on the reverse
 side of the ticket are produced by plates on an offset press ; identical
 information on each ticket . a second printing process is then required to add
 the variable information , which includes the section , seat and row numbers ,
 price and date of the event . this function can be accomplished , in line , by an
 lis provided system .
 lis printing systems are entirely digital and are dry toner based , which
 precludes the laborious press set - up and clean - up tasks , ink mixing and storage
 and the production of printing plates . the pressman simply runs the paper
 directly through lis ' s printer and it becomes an integral part of the press and
 the starting and stopping of the press and the placement of the digital object
 on the page are all under the control of lis proprietary software .
 nyse - listed dover corporation , the largest manufacturer of offset web presses ,
 estimates that there are more than 35 , 000 presses installed in the u . s . , with a
 press costing from $ 150 , 000 to several million and using as much as $ 10 , 000 of
 consumable products per month . dcpi ' s digitalcolorpress was designed to be
 installed on the majority of these presses , extending their life and utility by
 providing the printing of computer generated variable data in - line with the
 offset printing function . further , the system eliminates the need for preparing
 and storing printing plates , and inks and the expensive tasks of setting up a
 press for a print run , followed by tearing down after each job , cleaning the
 press and setting up for the next print job . dcpi estimates that the majority of
 printers will upgrade to color during the first two years of the
 digitalcolorpress availability and thousands more commercial printers will
 purchase systems through dcpi ' s direct sales force and distribution channel
 during the next two years .
 dcpi ' s first growth step is to increase consumable inventory to support existing
 lis systems , each installation generates about $ 6 , 000 per month in consumable
 purchases . secondly , to make lis ' s unique color press available from inventory
 and expand the current number of installed sites . thirdly , make the product
 offering available to the commercial printing industry . large tasks , but
 currently without any perceived competition or technological limitation .
 this stock will see major upward movement in the next several weeks . right
 now , dcpi is one of the street ' s best kept secrets , but it will not remain that
 way for long . this is a unique opportunity to get in while trading levels are
 still low . as the company goes forward with its business plan and signs major
 new contracts , this stock will move quickly . this is your last chance to invest
 before dcpi begins major price appreciation . this stock could reach $ 3 . 50 in the
 next five trading days !

""I have a dell inspirion 2650 laptop, with a P4 1.6GHz proc., an Nvidia Geforce II graphics card (8Mb) and am trying  to 
install redhat 7.3 .
The installation goes nicely until the Xwindows setup. My graphics card IS detected but not the monitor. I have  
randomly chosen various LCD laptop display monitors but none seem to work, problem is that when i test a  particular 
monitor the screen doesn't default back to the nice clear picture  i have become acustomed to but  remains fuzzy and 
flashy so it is impossible to test another monitor type. rebooting allows me to run in text mode  where i try to configure X 
again with Xconfigurator but i run into the same problem again.Very annoying...""Ta very, R----------------------------------------

finally ready to show you. We're proud to introduce our new Apparel
and Accessories store with over 400 major clothing brands (including
Gap, Old Navy, Nordstrom, Lands' End, Target, Eddie Bauer, Foot
Locker, and many more).Our goal is to provide complete apparel selection and offer it the
Amazon wayï¿½-with easy navigation, a single shopping cart, your
shipping and payment information already on file, etc. Of course, none
of this would be possible without our many apparel store partners
(we're thankful to have such an amazing group of companies working
with us).We released a beta version of the Apparel store about a week ago, and
much to our surprise, tens of thousands of clothing and accessory
items have already been ordered. Through the first few days of our
beta, customers have ordered:* 14,487 shirts (Polo Ralph Lauren button-downs to DKNY blouses)* 1,843 jackets (Old Navy fleece to Polartec windbreakers)* 2,712 sweaters (Eddie Bauer V-necks to Liz Claiborne cardigans)* 140 swimsuits (Tommy Bahama to Speedo)* 9,408 pants (Gap khakis to Guess jeans)* 485 skirts (Nordstrom suede to Spiegel leather)* 1,461 sleepwear items (Marshall Field's satin robes to Lands' End
  flannel pajamas)* 3,254 pairs of shoes (Nike Air Max to Nine West boots)* 1,870 pairs of socks (Cole Haan cashmere-blend to OshKosh B'Gosh
  cotton)* 2,805 accessories (handbags, watches, scarves, etc.)* 3,287 pairs of underwear (Jockey briefs to Hugo Boss boxers). We all
  need clean underwear, right?We hope you'll check it out. You'll get a $30 promotional certificate
when you spend $50 or more in the new Apparel store (see details
below). We'd especially appreciate any feedback you have (please

Date: Not suppliedGreat article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using 
semi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting 
computers are sent to the developing world for activist use.     For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone 
    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the 
    nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they 
    cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a 
    day's wage for most of the population.     The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are 
    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an 
    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any 
    international shipping duties on the computers. ""It's what you call real 
    free trade,"" says Eddie Nix.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Markoffcharney!_)[1] http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2002/09/23/antiglobal_geeks/index.html

 dealings with a related party have tarnished enron ' s ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) reputation and crushed its stock , but it looks like that case is far from unique .
 the battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities , according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing enron . moreover , enron ' s new cfo , who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related - party dealings of his predecessor , serves on 12 of these entities . and enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a houston - based related entity called es power 3 .
 the extent of enron ' s dealings with these companies , or the value of its holdings in them , couldn ' t be immediately determined . but the existence of these partnerships could feed investors ' fears that enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don ' t show up on its balance sheet . if that ' s so , the company ' s financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on wall street , where the company was long treated with kid gloves .
 enron didn ' t immediately respond to questions seeking details about es power or about the role of the chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , in the various entities . enron ' s board members couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment .
 ten long days
 enron ' s previous cfo , andrew fastow , was replaced by mcmahon wednesday after investors criticized fastow ' s role in a partnership called ljm , which had done complex hedging transactions with enron . as details of this deal and two others emerged , enron stock cratered .
 the turmoil that resulted in fastow ' s departure began two weeks ago , when enron reported third - quarter earnings that met estimates . however , the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $ 1 . 2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the ljm transactions . since then , investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities . enron stock sank 6 % friday , meaning it has lost 56 % of its value in just two weeks .

 however , enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities . the company has said nothing publicly about mcmahon ' s participation in related entities , nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in es power 3 . ( nor has it explained the extensive use of star wars - related names by the related - party companies . ) it ' s not immediately clear what es power 3 is or does . so far , subpoenas issued by lawyers suing enron have determined the names of senior officers of es power 3 and its formation date , january 1999 .
 among es power 3 ' s senior executives are enron ceo ken lay , listed as a director , and mcmahon and fastow , listed as executive vice presidents . a raft of external directors are named as es power 3 directors , including comdisco ceo norman blake and ronnie chan , chairman of the hong kong - based hang lung group . a comdisco spokeswoman says blake isn ' t commenting on matters concerning enron and a call to the hang lung group wasn ' t immediately returned .
 demands , demands
 rating agencies moody ' s , fitch and s & p recently put enron ' s credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an ljm deal that led to the $ 1 . 2 billion hit to equity . enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade . but its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade , or junk , bonds , suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely .
 if enron ' s rating drops below investment grade , it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $ 3 . 4 billion in off - balance sheet obligations . in addition , many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade .
 friday , the company drew down $ 3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations . raising cash in the cp market could be tough when investors are jittery about enron ' s condition .
 this week , a number of energy market players reduced exposure to enron . however , in a friday press release , ceo lay said that enron was the "" market - maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets . "" he added : "" it is evident that our customers view enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets . ""
 mcmahon reportedly objected to fastow ' s role in ljm , allegedly believing it posed fastow with a conflict of interests . but he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he ' s connected to don ' t do the same . enron has said that its board fully approved of the ljm deals that fastow was involved in . now , board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity .
 under the radar : enron ' s flickering bulb

 url :
 while the bulb at enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary ) may not have burnt out , it ' s clearly flickering . to date , investors aren ' t sure whether chairman and ceo ken lay is up to the task of re - energizing the company he once built to greatness .
 what ' s happened at the houston energy giant - turned - dwarf could ' ve been imagined with any number of ne ' er - do - well companies during the well - chronicled bubble . but this is enron . as one longtime enron bull and shareholder said , "" i never had to worry about enron ' s ability to survive until this week . i still find it hard to believe . ""
 peter eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling enron ' s adventures for some time . if you ' d listened to him earlier this year , you ' d have profited from his knowledge . his reporting on enron ' s partnership shenanigans to the departure of chief financial officer andrew fastow has been outstanding .
 the rumors - - from a pending bankruptcy to a justice department investigation - - are , for now , just that . and , enron did not single - handedly cause the california power crisis , nor is royal dutch / shell ( rd : nyse - news - commentary ) about to make a bid to buy the company . sources do tell me that head - count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business . and , while former ceo jeff skilling shares culpability for the current mess , his departure appears only indirectly related to enron ' s current woes .
 now , enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and , more importantly , its reputation .
 the company ' s challenge
 but what does enron do now ? it ' s very simple . come clean , clean up the mess and refocus on its core business : wholesale energy markets , risk management and retail energy services . they support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks .
 "" our gut feel is that enron can pull it off , and long - term investors should hold firm , as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings , with upside potential to $ 25 per share over the next 12 - 18 months , "" says jeff dietert , power analyst at simmons & co . and a member of the tsc energy roundtable . "" we believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery . ""
 dietert outlines four challenges for enron . one , management must regain the street ' s confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance - sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow . two , enron must maintain its investment - grade credit rating . three , enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans . four , enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write - down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book .
 straightforward ? yes . easy to accomplish ? no .
 although enron says additional write - downs are unlikely - - except a $ 200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change - - analysts aren ' t so sure . they ' re focused on the company ' s global assets portfolio , sporting $ 6 billion in book value but generating an ebit ( earnings before interest and taxes ) loss of $ 18 million over the past 12 months .
 the divestitures include $ 390 million in exploration and production assets in india , $ 250 million in a puerto rico power plant and $ 250 million in a brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of portland general , which is set to close in 2002 . there will likely be others . however , enron has to execute here , and given the current state of its affairs , the seller will feel the pressure .
 the credit - rating issue is a fine line . the current ratings , bbb + from standard & poor ' s and baal from moody ' s , are three levels above non - investment grade . however , both rating agencies now have enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades . dietert estimates that enron ' s debt - to - market cap will be about 48 % by year - end , and the company has interest coverage ( ebitda / interest expense ) of about 3 . 5 times . by comparison , the average s the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades ; potentially lower credit ratings force counter - parties to reduce exposure to enron , limiting enron ' s ability to generate earnings and cash flow . ""
 it ' s time for enron to grow up . despite a lot of uncertainties and risk , i think it will . investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy . it ' s a tough call that requires strict , individual discipline .
 there ' s an irony to this whole story , especially in enron ' s lack of candor in reporting its financial results . in a much - lauded advertising campaign , enron , looking to challenge conventional wisdom , asks the simple question , "" why ? ask why . ""
 investors are now asking . it ' s time for ken lay to answer .
 first things first
 many readers have asked about my relative quietness this week . thank you for your concern . my father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade .
 the choice was easy . i ' m with him and my family .
 enjoy your weekend with family and friends .
 dj enron unit , new england market downplay report of default
 2001 - 10 - 26 17 : 14 ( new york )
 by kristen mcnamara
 of dow jones newswires
 new york ( dow jones ) - - enron corp . ' s ( ene ) retail sales unit defaulted on its
 credit requirement in new england ' s wholesale power market this month , but the
 event was neither unique nor newsworthy , the energy company and the
 organization that developed the market ' s rules said friday .
 the operator of the region ' s wholesale power market informed enron energy
 services last week that , for the third time in 12 months , it had traded a
 greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
 risk for expulsion from new england ' s market .
 but it was administrative mixups , rather than financial problems , that
 triggered the warning , which a few other companies have also received in the
 past , the market ' s rulemaker said .
 "" i can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
 participants "" that have defaulted on their credit agreements , "" and it ' s never
 been in the news , "" said david doot , secretary and general counsel for the new
 england power pool , which developed the policies governing the region ' s
 electricity market . "" my instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
 proportion . ""
 news of the enron unit ' s default appeared in a trade publication and a major
 metropolitan newspaper this week , as enron ' s dealings with partnerships headed
 by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company ' s
 stock and bond prices .
 enron energy services never received word that it had defaulted on its
 bonding requirement twice before , because both times it corrected the problem
 within a day , spokeswoman peggy mahoney said .
 the letter sent by iso new england , which operates the region ' s power market ,
 to notify the enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
 person , delaying the company ' s response , mahoney said .
 "" clearly , it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
 ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit , "" mahoney said .
 the company resolved the problem by oct . 19 , mahoney said . iso new england
 spokeswoman ellen foley confirmed friday that the company had cured its
 default .
 it ' s rare for a company to default three times , but it has happened on
 occasion , foley and doot said .
 "" i won ' t say it ' s commonplace , but i won ' t say it ' s unusual for a participant
 to find itself out of compliance , "" doot said . "" those things have in fact
 happened from time to time . ""

 enron lawsuit over microsoft broadband agreement may block msn
 2001 - 10 - 26 16 : 47 ( new york )
 enron lawsuit over microsoft broadband agreement may block msn
 houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s lawsuit
 alleging microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
 could temporarily block the largest software company ' s high - speed
 internet service in some u . s . regions .
 microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
 from providing the high - speed service in areas where enron
 provides broadband access , leaving msn fully operational only in
 the 14 states where qwest communications international inc .
 operates , said bob visse , director of marketing for msn .
 enron ' s lawsuit was filed yesterday . microsoft had planned to
 offer fast internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
 give the largest software company access to potential customers in
 29 million homes . microsoft , the no . 2 u . s . internet provider , is
 making a push to win customers from aol time warner inc .
 ` ` we are trying to resolve the issues with enron as quickly
 as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
 providers , ' ' visse said .
 officials at houston - based enron , the largest energy trader ,
 did not immediately return calls for comment .
 the agreement
 enron in june signed an agreement with microsoft to provide
 bandwidth for msn internet service . under the agreement , enron
 isn ' t required to deliver operational broadband services if
 microsoft hasn ' t first provided a billing and ordering system , dow
 jones newswire reported .
 enron claims in its lawsuit that microsoft failed to deliver
 the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
 the deal , dow reported .
 enron ' s lawsuit comes after microsoft said in an oct . 23
 letter that enron will have breached the contract if it hasn ' t
 provided an operational bandwidth system by oct . 25 , allowing
 microsoft to recover damages .
 shares of redmond , washington - based microsoft fell 36 cents
 to $ 62 . 20 , while enron shares fell 95 cents to $ 15 . 40 .

 enron executives sent requests for details of affiliate profits
 2001 - 10 - 26 15 : 36 ( new york )
 enron executives sent requests for details of affiliate profits
 houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - lawyers for a shareholder
 suing enron corp . are asking executives of the largest energy
 trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
 with affiliated companies that bought and sold enron assets .
 lawyers have made the requests to president greg whalley ,
 vice chairman mark frevert and chief financial officer jeff
 mcmahon and 83 other employees arrived at enron ' s houston offices
 this week , said paul paradis , a partner in the new york law firm
 abbey gardy . requests also were sent to 17 enron partnerships such
 as whitewing management and marlin water .
 paradis represents fred greenberg , an enron shareholder who
 is suing the company ' s board for allowing former chief financial
 officer andrew fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
 least $ 35 million in cash and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost shareholder
 equity .
 the requests are aimed at determining if enron executives
 benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
 partnerships that bought and sold company assets . enron formed at
 least 18 such affiliated companies , listing executives and
 employees as officers and directors of the partnerships , according
 to texas secretary of state records .
 under texas law , failure to respond to the document requests
 will result in subpoenas being issued . subpoenas could go out next
 week if responses don ' t arrive by then , paradis said . enron
 spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to requests for comment
 about the document requests .
 the executives earned no income from the partnerships , enron
 spokesman mark palmer has said . ` ` there are no financial interests
 in the structures themselves for any enron employee , ' ' palmer
 said . he said it ' s common for a company to name its executives to
 the boards of affiliates .
 affiliates have debts
 texas records show chief executive officer kenneth lay ,
 frevert , whalley , mcmahon and dozens of other people who list
 their address as enron ' s corporate headquarters serving as
 officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
 business corporations .
 the document requests ask enron executives for information on
 any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
 affiliates , including stock grants and options . they also ask the
 executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
 affiliates .
 enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
 such as power plants and natural - gas pipelines . that allowed enron
 to move debt associated with those projects off its books .
 the affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money . they
 plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets . enron
 might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
 the debt . that could amount to at least $ 3 . 3 billion if the assets
 don ' t generate any money , a remote possibility , the company has
 said .
 few answers
 investors and analysts pressed enron chief executive officer
 kenneth lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
 conference call tuesday .
 today , enron spokeswoman karen denne didn ' t respond to
 questions about one of them , es power 3 llc .
 texas records list 78 enron executives and employees as
 officers , directors and managers of es power 3 llc . the entire
 enron board is also listed .

 enron still target in california amid other problems ( updatel )
 ( updates with closing share price in last paragraph . )
 sacramento , california , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ,
 facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
 partnerships run by the former chief financial officer , remains a
 target of investigations and lawsuits in california .
 california lawmakers and regulators have accused power
 providers of manipulating the state ' s energy market to raise
 prices . enron , the biggest energy trader , and other power sellers
 have denied the charges repeatedly .
 next month , a california senate committee investigating the
 power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if enron and
 other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
 documents . enron has been filing documents in sacramento ,
 california .
 ` ` they are still putting documents in their depository , and i
 don ' t think they ' ve completed that process , ' ' said alexandra
 montgomery , a consultant to the committee . it ` ` remains to be
 seen ' ' whether enron is complying with its subpoena , she said .
 the suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
 california soared , leaving the state ' s two largest utilities
 insolvent . under california ' s plan to open its electricity market
 to competition , the utilities of pg & e corp . and edison
 international weren ' t allowed to pass rising costs to customers .
 ` ` i know that we ' re doing our best to comply with what the
 committee is asking for , ' ' enron spokesman mark palmer . ` ` we are
 putting documents in the depository , and we ' re looking forward to
 a speedy resolution . ' '
 shares of houston - based enron have fallen by more than half
 since oct . 16 . the company ousted andrew fastow as the chief
 financial officer wednesday amid a u . s . securities and exchange
 commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost enron $ 35
 million .
 grand jury
 enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
 civil and criminal violations by california attorney general bill
 lockyer , who convened a grand jury in june .
 lockyer has been criticized by enron officials for telling
 the wall street journal in may that he would like to put enron
 chairman kenneth lay in ` ` an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
 a tattooed dude who says ` hi my name is spike , honey . ' ' ' lockyer
 later apologized for the remark .
 the attorney general ' s investigation is proceeding , lockyer
 spokeswoman sandra michioku said . michioku said she didn ' t know
 when civil or criminal charges against enron or other power
 providers might be filed .
 ` ` our investigation is still being pursued , ' ' she said . ` ` we
 had to go to court to get enron to turn over documents , so that
 slowed things down a bit . ' '
 enron ' s palmer said he didn ' t know the status of the attorney
 general ' s investigation .
 ` ` i think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
 to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
 vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman , ' ' palmer said .
 more lawsuits
 enron , along with other major power providers such as duke
 energy corp . and dynegy inc . , face at least five lawsuits alleging
 they manipulated california energy prices in violation of
 antitrust laws .
 the cases , which include separate complaints filed by the
 city of san francisco , california lieutenant governor cruz
 bustamante and various consumers , currently are in state courts
 awaiting a coordination proceeding , said michael aguirre , a lawyer
 representing bustamante . the lawsuits should be assigned to a
 judge by the end of next month , he said .
 if the complaints succeed , the companies might be ordered to
 repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines , including
 triple damages .
 enron ' s stock fell 95 cents , or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 ,
 declining for the eighth day in a row . the shares have fallen 80
 percent in the past 12 months .

 enron bonds fall as company taps $ 3 bln credit line ( update 5 )
 ( adds investor comment in fourth paragraph . )
 houston , oct . 26 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . bonds and shares
 fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $ 3 billion credit
 line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low -
 interest , short - term loans .
 the company ' s stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
 after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
 enron ' s former chief financial officer . the shares fell 95 cents ,
 or 5 . 8 percent , to $ 15 . 40 today .
 chief executive officer kenneth lay has failed to reassure
 investors that the company ' s credit rating won ' t be cut , investors
 said . enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets ,
 where short - term loans carry lower rates than banks offer .
 ` ` do they have the financial flexibility they once had ? no , ' '
 said john cassady , who helps manage $ 3 billion in bonds at fifth
 third bancorp . ` ` people are questioning the credibility of
 management . ' '
 the company will use its credit line to pay off $ 2 . 2 billion
 in commercial paper it has outstanding , enron spokesman mark
 palmer said .
 bonds drop
 enron ' s 6 3 / 4 percent bonds , which mature in 2009 , declined 1
 1 / 2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
 cents . at that price , the bonds , which carry a rating of ` ` bbb + , ' '
 yield 9 . 53 percent .
 investors have grown concerned that the company ' s credit
 rating will be cut after $ 1 . 01 billion in third - quarter losses
 from failed investments . enron needs good credit to raise cash
 daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
 settle transactions .
 enron ' s decision to tap its credit line was ` ` a smart
 financial move , ' ' said stephen moore , a vice president at moody ' s
 investors service who follows the company . ` ` it took away the
 hassle and time - consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
 insured access to capital . ' '
 though enron ' s bonds have investment - grade ratings , their
 yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
 that carry junk ratings . according to bloomberg data , companies
 with ` ` bb ' ' ratings pay on average 9 . 16 percent to borrow for
 seven years .
 a lower credit rating may also force enron to buy back
 holdings in other partnerships with its stock , diluting the value
 of enron investors ' stock .
 partnerships called whitewing , marlin and yosemite own enron
 assets they bought with borrowed money . enron sold the assets to
 the partnerships to keep related debt off its books . the
 partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
 assets .
 other liabilities
 if enron loses investment - grade rating , the borrowed money
 comes due earlier , leaving less time for the partnerships to find
 the best price for the power plants and other assets . enron would
 have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
 for and the amount of the debt .
 one way would be issuing common shares to exchange for enron
 preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships . that would
 thin out the holdings of every other investor .
 of the two main bond - rating companies , moody ' s and fitch have
 enron on watch for possible downgrade , and standard & poor ' s
 lowered enron ' s long - term credit outlook to negative . egan - jones
 rating co . today lowered its rating on enron ' s debt to ` ` bb + , ' '
 one notch below investment grade , from ` ` bbb - . ' '
 enron ' s liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
 to at least $ 3 . 3 billion , the company has said .
 enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow on
 wednesday amid a securities and exchange commission inquiry into a
 partnership he ran that cost the company $ 35 million in direct
 losses . enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
 partnership , reducing shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion .
 ` ` it looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
 the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
 benefit of himself , ' ' fifth third ' s cassady said .
 jeff mcmahon , head of enron ' s industrial markets group , was
 named cfo in a bid to restore investor confidence , lay said in a
 statement .

 seattle - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 26 , 2001 - - seattle ' s keller rohrback l . l . p . is currently investigating potential erisa claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of enron ' s retirement and 401 ( k ) plans .
 the investigation period covers january 2000 through october 2001 . the investigation focuses on concerns that , under the law interpreting erisa , enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a plan investment . rather than providing complete and accurate information to the plans ' participants , it may be alleged that enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information , thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the plans . this investigation is being conducted in light of recent events .
 on oct . 16 , 2001 , enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking "" non - recurring charges totaling $ 1 . 01 billion after - tax , or ( $ 1 . 11 ) loss per diluted share , "" in the third quarter of 2001 . enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships , controlled by enron ' s cfo , and that the company would be eliminating more than $ 1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments . as this news began to be assimilated by the market , the price of enron common stock dropped significantly . in addition , several recently filed securities suits allege that enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading , gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds . enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets .

""parroting the party line"".It was even less so thirty years ago. My story remains the same, take it 
or leave it. I've said the same words to white supremacists as to 
suburban leftist punks as to homeys as to French Irish, etc. etc.:I don't have to agree with anything you say. I *am* obligated to defend 
to the death your right to say it. I don't give a rat's ass where you

http://www.guardian.co.uk/Print/0%2c3858%2c4489999%2c00.htmlMaking a mesh on the moveA new way to give us fast mobile net access spells further trouble for 3G, 
reports Peter RojasPeter Rojas
Thursday August 29, 2002
The GuardianImagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than DSL from 
anywhere, at any time - you could watch a live video webcast while waiting 
for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or 
download the MP3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes.This is the vision of a high-speed wireless internet paradise that the 
third-generation (3G) mobile phone companies have been promoting for 
years. 3G services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new 
technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision 
sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever 
dream.Two companies, US startup MeshNetworks and Moteran Networks of Germany, 
are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. 
Instead of the current hub-and-spoke model of wireless communications, 
with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time 
""mesh-enabled"" devices - mobile phones, PDAs, laptops - are in close 
proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh 
network. Every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying 
traffic for everyone else. Traffic hops from person to person until it 
reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central 
antennas, and improving wireless coverage.As the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless PDAs, laptops, and 
other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless 
networking may be inevitable.Mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3G wireless 
networks. While 3G operators roll out mobile services that offer users 
connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a 
dial-up modem), Moteran and MeshNetworks are able to offer connection 
speeds of up to 6Mbps, over a hundred times faster than dial-up. The 
technologies they use include Wi-Fi - the emerging standard for high-speed 
wireless networking also known as 802.11b. A similarly short-range 
protocol called UltraWideBand, which is poised to succeed Wi-Fi, is even 
faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 Mbps.The range of a typical Wi-Fi network is generally too limited to be of 
much use when travelling around a city. Mesh networks get around the 
problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. 
Even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, 
because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, 
connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3G wireless 
connection.Because mesh networks use Wi-Fi, the equipment and infrastructure needed 
to create them is cheap and readily available. Instead of building 
cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all 
that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 
Â£100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the 
proper software. Existing laptops and PDAs can be mesh-enabled by 
software.It also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. 
Unlike with 3G cellular, the part of the spectrum that Wi-Fi operates on 
is unregulated in the US, Britain. The mobile phone companies are none too 
pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds 
acquiring 3G licences.All that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect 
to the network. With every additional customer that signs up coverage gets 
better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone 
networks.But things get very interesting when you realise that when you have 
high-speed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, PDAs, 
and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing 
music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. When 
UltraWideBand hits, all of this will just accelerate.At 400Mbps, copying a pirated copy of the Lord of the Rings from the 
person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. 
Sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of 
their favourite songs, movies, and video games.But the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. 
MeshNetworks has no plans to offer its own high-speed wireless service. 
Instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities 
that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works 
employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the 
cheap. Moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for 
enterprise networks.The first place average users may use the technology is when it is 
incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at 
high speeds, which both companies see happening soon.When will you be able to wander around town with a 6Mbps connection in 
your pocket? It's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service 
was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually 
someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.

 i believe all of you received a request from jeremy blachman to hold the
 afternoon of january 10 th open for an off - site to discuss the manner in which
 rac and research assess / test the credit quality of ees transactions . i
 realize that rac and ees have had many discussions as to the methodology , but
 it might be helpful for all of us to understand the actual derivation of some
 of analysis . please call me with any questions or comments at ext # 30349 .
 the agenda will be as follows :
 12 : 00 - 1 : 00 lunch
 1 : 00 - 3 : 30 presentations
 3 : 30 - to close discussion
 rac / research presentations
 the following topics would be of interest to ees :
 1 - the derivation of default probabilities including ( research )
 - - a discussion of the actual mathematical process ,
 - - the analytics behind why these computations are deemed the best for
 enron ,
 - - a comparison to historic default rates and why they differ ( in respect
 to actual default rates , shape of the cumulative default curves etc .
 2 - the volatilities which are used to determine possible loss scenarios for
 the commodity portion of ees deals including ( research )
 - - the selection of curves
 - - the application of those curves to the actual credit reserve model and
 - - why these particular tests are applicable to our products .
 3 - the recovery rates used in the credit reserve model . how are these
 figures derived ? ( rac )
 4 - how rac and research have adjusted the credit reserve model to
 accommodate unusual aspects of the deal including ( rac )
 - - promotion payments ,
 - - accounts receivable
 - - committed capital
 - - and other factors
 ees also understands that some of you may be familiar with our processes ,
 however , there are perhaps areas that you would like to understand more
 fully . please tell us what you would like to hear from us .
 also , rac has sent us the credit reserve model and i have seen completed
 models . perhaps prior to our meeting on wednesday , someone from rac and / or
 research could sit with me and someone from phil layton ' s group and go
 through the process of how the various pieces are put together ."

 your morning thought for the day :
 retirement at 65 is ridiculous .
 when i was 65 i still had pimples .

 it ' s summer vacation time and parents will soon be hearing from
 their kids that they ' re bored .
 one of the biggest regrets we hear from the older generation , is
 that kids lack the playful imagination that was common a generation
 or two ago .
 back in the "" olden days "" , kids knew how to entertain themselves
 with surprisingly little . there was no such thing as playstation .
 kids ran outside to play kick - the - can in a game that was shockingly
 not organized by adults . they actually did it themselves .
 today , mike shares some thoughts about kids and modern
 imagination - - or lack thereof . . .

 just imagine
 by michael t . smith
 when i married ginny , i gained a new son , daughter and four
 grandsons . i became an instant grandpa .
 over the july 4 th holiday , i got to meet my new daughter and her
 three boys for the first time . it took a day for my new grandsons to
 warm up to me .
 the first day they stared at me , perhaps wondering what they
 were supposed to do with this man , who they were told is "" grandpa . ""
 i waited patiently . i knew boys like to play . they ' d come to me in
 their own time .
 on day two , the oldest two were doing summersaults over my lap .
 the youngest , ben , took a little longer , but yesterday he raced me
 across the yard thirty times and won every time .
 the weekend brought back memories of my own childhood . we had
 such imaginations . in our minds , a tree was a tower to spot
 approaching bad guys , a big rock became a mountain , a fallen log a
 space ship headed to the stars . we had toys , but we had to use our
 imagination , not like the new toys i see my grandkids with .
 our toys didn ' t talk , and if they did , you pulled a string to
 make it work . we had blocks to build , crayons to create , trucks and
 cars to push . they were simple toys that required imagination . i
 thought about the toys in my garage , the ones i saved , when my
 children outgrew them . they were simple and needed their imagination
 to work . mr . potato head allowed them to learn parts of the body and
 giggle at the funny face with an ear where its mouth should have been .
 i still have an old plastic phone . it has a dial to turn , a
 bell that rings when you push a button , and that ' s it . it doesn ' t
 talk , squawk , beep or move around the room . it ' s simple and was used
 when they played house , nurse , doctor , and secretary .
 i have a toy doctor ' s bag , with all the plastic doctor ' s tools .
 i remember all the broken bones , cuts , bangs , scratches and aches my
 daughter repaired as i lay in her office moaning .
 most toys today do it all . we don ' t need imagination - - it
 comes in a box . video games that take us into another world or
 reality , talking toys , with vocabularies better than most people ,
 computerized toys to teach the alphabet . kids sit and have
 imagination brought to them . the teaching toys are great , but
 children tire of them - - it ' s like being in school .
 when my son was young and tired of his toys , he would come to me
 and say , "" dad , i ' m bored . ""
 "" go find something to do , "" i ' d reply .
 "" i don ' t know what to do . ""
 "" go outside and find a friend . ""
 "" naaa ! i don ' t want to do that . ""
 "" use your imagination . ""
 "" huh ? "" he asked .
 "" well , when i was young . . . "" you know the routine .
 sports is the same . we ' re entertained for hours watching
 someone else have fun doing what they ' re good at . wouldn ' t it be
 better to be playing yourself ? if we don ' t like the sports available
 to watch , we create new ones . it doesn ' t matter what , people will
 pay to see it , because they need to be entertained . i haven ' t heard
 of world championship worm digging , but if someone offered a large
 cash price , people would buy tickets to scream at the contestants .
 i worry . are we becoming a society that needs outside influence
 to have fun ?
 i think i ' ll go climb a tree .
 maybe there ' s a pirate ship on the horizon or someone is
 attacking my castle .
 just imagine .

 michael lives in new jersey with his new wife and son .
 from our mailbag :
 ( in response to last week ' s story , cinderella men )
 dear heartwarmers :
 last week ' s heartwarming story opened a door to memory lane . i
 too , was born in the 30 s and felt some of the poverty of that time .
 i remember my mom and dad who never complained of the fatigue that
 was so ever present in their lives . we were very fortunate in as
 much as we always had plenty of food and warm shelter . we had a
 garden and salvaged every edible product available - - even certain
 "" weeds "" that were quite tasty after mother got all the spices in
 them . i had several beautiful dresses made from feed sacks that i
 wore with pride ! we were very poor , but so rich indeed because we
 had love and the knowledge that god was upper most in our lives , and
 it taught us lessons that had never been printed in the books . i
 deeply appreciate those lessons of long ago because they have taught
 me how to handle the tough times we have encountered in this life of
 prosperity and promise . thank you again for your lovely story . god
 bless .

 the following is a message that heather sent to me after we talked about this deal and she did some additional research . a synopsis of this deal :
 geir entered the deal on 4 - 24 - 01 . buy $ 320 , sell $ 30 , creating a $ 290 . 00 per mw charge to your books
 you went back on 4 - 27 - 01 and corrected the sel price to $ 300 , changing the $ 290 . 00 charge to your books to a $ 20 per mw charge to your book .
 since this is an intra - month change , portland risk should recognize this when the compare it to their liqrec report and they should recognize a $ 108 , 000 credit back in your pma ' s . ( since the change was done before month - end , this never hit settlements to pull thru for dpr because by the time settlements looked at it , it was correct . )
 my point here is that you will see this credit in your pma ' s , you just haven ' t yet . with the transition of people in risk , one of the functions that got delayed was the true - up between the liqrec report and the end of the month intra - month changes report , which is where your variance is sitting now . risk is aware that this is out there and they are doing their best to true these types of things up . as of today , they are working back to january . right now , they can ' t give me a timeline of when this will be recognized , but please be assured that they are working on it .
 heather has requested that if you have specific questions , that you direct them to her . she will also let you know as soon as she has a good idea of when they will be caught up .
 please also feel free to ask me any questions about the processes . i ' ll help you in any way that i can .
 thanks for pointing this out to us . anything that can help us to stay on top of these processes is always a plus .
 virginia
 also concerning w - bom 590753 .
 what happens when a deal is changed in the same month after the flow date - risk can calculate the difference and add it to the liquidation value .
 or what happens is that we re - run the reports for customers and desk - to - desk and compare to another report called the liqrec ( liquidation reconcilation ) the differences we should run through the books .
 john is working on that . he is starting in jan . - so you can let bill know that yes it has not come through yet - and risk will enter that .
 i will give him a better timeline of when that will happen when i know .
 thanks for all of your help on this virginia .

  Test the hub ports by switching cables around.
  Run ifconfig on the server - any errors and what kind they are.
  Test the network card... by replacing the thing!Seriously, if the server has a PCI slot free, something like a Realtek 8139
based card costs less than 20 euro.  The design is a couple of generations later
- more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the
card and it's PCI.  Ronan.

0,"Subject: confirmations for monterrey office
 have a good trip to monterrey . i hope that these bullet points help in your discussions tomorrow . - - sally
 ? gordon heaney ( houston ) was named as the operations liasion for the monterrey office after the doorstep review during the first quarter . he is fluent in spanish . confirmations have been prepared in houston since the inception of the mexico business .
 ? since that time , gordon and his boss , joe hunter ( manager over derivatives confirmations ) , have made a trip to monterrey to meet the commercial team and to iron out the process flow for confirmations .
 ? gordon and joe meet with agustin perez and jaime williams when they are in houston for bid week each month .
 ? last meeting with agustin and jaime was last week here in houston . primary focus of the conversation was around involving the commercial team in working with counterparties to get executed confirmations back in our hands . our commitment is to get a spreadsheet to agustin and jaime each week that details unexecuted confirmations and responses , or lack thereof , from the counterparties . that way the commercial teams can push with their commercial contacts and gordon can push with his contacts for executed confirmations . the first of these spreadsheets was sent to the monterrey office today , per the commitment from gordon and joe last week .
 creation of confirmations : timing has improved since first quarter , as 25 to 30 % of the deals are now done with counterparties who have recently executed isda master agreements . confirmations for deals done with these counterparties are being sent trade date + 1 . for counterparties without master agreements in place , there are often special riders to the confirmations with input required from credit and legal . these confirmations naturally take longer and are going out to the counterparties sometime after trade date + 1 . i have asked joe and gordon to diligently push credit and legal to complete this process more promptly .
 execution of confirmations : we have found that the counterparties in mexico are more interested in having the invoice in hand as their documentation on a deal than in returning a signed confirmation to us . this is an education process that we will continue to work on with the help of the commercial team in monterrey .
 my opinion : let ' s try the weekly spreadsheet status on unexecuted confirmations for a few weeks and monitor progress . it is my opinion that there is not the depth of business yet in the monterrey office to warrant a fulltime confirmations person located there . i think that the bilingual contact here working closely with the commercial team in monterrey will make a difference ."
0,"Subject: rate of loss for "" basic "" vocabulary
 
 some months ago there was an extended discussion of the proposal made in the fifties by swadesh that there are certain lists of meanings which have the property that the words expressing them are lost at a fairly constant rate per millennium in all languages , in particular , a certain 100 - meaning list where the rate is around 86 % . while noting that bergsland and vogt have adduced examples where the rate seems to be lower , i pointed out that i had not found any examples where it was clearly higher . jacques guy referred to the eastern greenlandic data discussed by bergsland and vogt in current anthropology in 1962 , but , having just carefully read this paper , i see that they state that , while they surmise that the rate here was higher , they cannot calculate what is was ( presuumably because there are no sources for greenlandic that are old enough ) . moreover , the purely conjectural rate of 72 % which they mention is still low enough for the purposes of the original discussion we were having about this , namely , to assure that in a family with enough ramification there would be a substantial portion of the original vocabulary reflected in at least two descendants after far more than 10 , 000 years ( provided each language was independely losing 28 % of the original vocabulary per millennium ) . i do n't have the numbers handy , but jacques , who is better at this anyway , can probably whip some up . but i should also add that bergsland nd vogt 's data are also consistent with many other assumptions , notably , that the rate of retention in e . greenlandic was 86 % , but that it was substanitally lower in some other eskimo languages ( because all they have is the result that e . greenlandic is as different lexically from w . greenlandic as the two together are from yupik , which makes no sense given the family tree if the rates are the same eveywhere ) . but this could be due to slower vocabulary loss in yupik ( or even in the common ancestror of e . and w . greenlandic , or both ) just as well as to faster loss in e . greenlandic . so there is no justification that i can find for bergsland and vogt 's or guy 's assumption that the "" prolem "" lies in a faster rate of loss in e . greenlandic .

 strictly confidential .
 i am pleased to get across to you for a profitable business proposal ,
 though i don ' t know you and we had never meant in person but i got your
 contact from the personal assistance to the former minister for sports .
 more so she told me that this is your first time in partaking in such
 business but you are in a better position to handle the
 transaction / business of this magnitude without you running away with our
 own share of fund once your account is credited within 4 - 5 working days
 because before i commence we have to build mutual relationship in respect
 of this business that is strictly confidential and all the legal
 / essential documents to back up this transaction are in place . and the key
 for us building up this mutual relationship is trust between both parties
 involved that is you and i . i am in charge of the auditing for contract
 payment with safa ( south african football association ) and i truly
 apologize for using this means to reach you because i have no other
 choice . within the south african football association and the cooperation
 of my colleague , i have in my possession as overdue payment bills totaling
 eighteen million three hundred thousand u . s . dollars ( us $ 18 , 3 m ) . with
 your assistance and fullest co - operation , i on behalf of my colleague beg
 you to help us receive these funds by wire transfer that is presently
 lying in a suspended account with absa bank in pretoria branch . it does
 matter whether it is a cooperate or personal account but as long as the
 account is active to receive the amount of this magnitude , it is very ok
 to us . more so , we are handicapped in the circumstances , as the south
 africa civil service code of conduct does not permit us to operate
 offshore / foreign account of any kind hence you are very important to wards
 the successful completion of this whole transaction that we shall both
 benefits from . this us $ 18 . 3 m arose from the balance of the total contract
 value for the renovation and upgrading of ( pretoria , johannesburg and
 soweto national stadium for 2006 bid that we lost to germany before it was
 awarded to us again in 2010 with the help of our former president mr
 nelson mandela ) our national stadium by foreign contracting firm , which we
 the officials over - invoiced deliberately . though the actual contract cost
 have been fully paid to the original contractor . i have the authority of
 my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us
 ( which i prayed and beg for ) in the transaction ; your share of the sum
 will be 25 % of the total amount after tax in any account you shall provide
 for the funds to be transferred into , 70 % for us and 5 % for taxation and
 miscellaneous expenses . the business itself is 100 % safe , on your part
 provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality . also your
 area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of
 this transaction . i have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
 will not disappoint me because our share of the funds with your assistance
 we shall invest in property management / real estate business in your
 country . and that is why we offered you 25 % of the total amount not just
 to receive the funds for us alone because once the fund is transferred to
 your account without your help we shall be lost since most of my life i
 have been a civil servant .
 endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel and fax number or
 my e - mail address : mrs _ mabo @ latinmail . com
 if you are willing to help in this matter and i also want to guarantee
 you that my partner and myself are in a better position to make the
 payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong
 assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember
 to treat this matter as very confidential matter , because we will not
 comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active government
 service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this
 business . i wait in anticipation of your earliest response .
 yours truly ,
 engr . erick mabo"

 insight
 title : extending eu gas guidelines to central and eastern europe
 url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2184
 overview : a comprehensive reform of gas legislation in central and eastern
 europe is bringing the region in line with the european union  , s gas
 directive . this is true both for the countries expected to enter the union by
 2004  ) 05  * czech republic , estonia , hungary , poland , and slovenia - - and for
 candidates whose entry is not scheduled before the end of the
 decade - - bulgaria , latvia , lithuania , romania , and slovakia . in cera  , s view
 current developments regarding the establishment of a legal framework for the
 internal gas market in eastern and central europe look promising from an
 investor  , s point of view .
 the candidate countries presented a review of progress made in the
 implementation of the eu gas directive during a two - day workshop held by the
 european commission and the world bank in paris in november .
 many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries
 throughout the 1990 s as part of their transition to a market economy . the
 results have been mixed , particularly in the utility industries . the 1998 gas
 directive ( adopted in august 2000 ) now offers a compelling incentive for eu
 candidate countries to transform their gas industries , while providing a road
 map to guide them .
 the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union and
 candidate countries include the following :
 * legal framework and regulation . the legal framework is the cornerstone of
 enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe . as a result , in all
 candidate countries in 1999  ) 2000 energy laws were either updated or newly
 established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive . regulatory
 bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country , although
 issues of staffing , financial autonomy , and independence from political
 influence are not uniformly resolved .
 * third - party access ( tpa ) and long - term take - or - pay contracts . all candidate
 countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition . therefore , all have
 adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation . although the
 commission favors regulated tpa , the specific approaches to tpa enforcement
 in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases . in particular , the
 implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of long - term take - or - pay
 contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies
 and somewhat preempt competition . russian gas is for the most part sold to
 single , traditional state - owned operators that dominate their internal
 markets . a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant
 players and the competitive environment . this is made more complicated by
 their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchange
 for transit rights to west european customers . article 25 of the directive
 provides for !
 a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from take - or - pay
 obligations . this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate
 countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industry .
 furthermore , article 26 allows derogations to those member states with only
 one major gas supplier , to those with an  +  + emerging gas market
 status ,  ,  , or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another
 member state . most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to
 call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the
 european union .
 * price cross - subsidies . residential gas tariffs are artificially low and are
 financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers . in
 various countries , tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have
 been scheduled , but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce .
 this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage of
 imported gas to oil prices . all candidate countries have set legal frameworks
 that include the phasing out of cross - subsidies as part of sector reform , but
 the actual implementation will remain politically difficult . as table 1
 indicates , price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expected
 to enter the european union by mid - decade , but the legal framework itself
 cannot guarantee the pace of reform . the same goes for candidate countries
 that have only recently introduced eu - complying energy laws and whose entry
 to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame .
 * unbundling . most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission
 companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of
 liberalization . to date , unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is
 all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countries .
 in the future , the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal
 separation (  & structural unbundling  8 ) of the businesses , and candidate
 countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly .
 table 1 gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries . as the
 table shows , the countries belonging to the second group have only very
 recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the
 directive , whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries
 scheduled for the first wave .

Eliminator's all natural ingredients help you
sleep!Â Â Â Â Â Â  1r
Is snoring
keeping you up all night? No
more sleepless nights with
Snore Eliminator!!

Do you know someone with a snoring problem? Snore Eliminator will help them
and they will love you for it.
Improve your sexual performance by reducing snoring and thus increasing
oxygen to your body!!People who snore have a higher risk of developing heart attacks, high blood
pressure, or strokes!! Snoring
also causes sleep disturbances that lead to increased anxiety,
hyperirritability, and decreased memory!
Individuals who snore have a 90% chance of daytime fatigue. Nine out of every
ten victims are male!How the Snore Eliminator will help you!What Causes Snoring?Over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle
Excessive fat on the throat
Accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and
Throat swelling from allergies and food
Heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the stopping
of breathing, during sleep. As
an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. This can be a very hazardous
problem if someone is not getting proper REM sleep. Snoring is the audible
symptom of a blocked airway during sleep.The noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
to take in a weakened current of incoming air. This blockage may result
from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
problem.
Snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who sleep on their
backs; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.The hidden dangers of snoring?
Snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated
Hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring
Snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical conditionSnoring decreases sexual performance
by half, due to lack of oxygen
to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.
Most people who snore have a shortage
of oxygen for a
significant portion of that person's life. In recent studies, daytime fatigue
and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. In a few cases, heavy
snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. Sleep apnea in which
breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
snorting and tossing around. This pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
night long. The result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.How the Snore Eliminator works!Snore Eliminator offers a unique break through with its all natural
enzymes which metabolize the
secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. The
herbs reduce tissue swelling. The result is to open the airway and smooth the
airflow. This in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. It also
reduces the noise made by
breathing through the mouth while sleeping.
By simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
is coated. This allows the throat
a chance to relax thus a
reduced amount of snoring. In most cases snoring is eliminated. Snore Eliminator
coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.TESTIMONIALS from several of our satisfied customers:Lorenzo writes...
I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.
PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.
Alex writes...
My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.
Thank you for a product that has really helped us!
Glen writes...
In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard

improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
had been in years. Thanks.

0,"Subject: re : 5 . 1370 can the comparative method be applied to syntax ?
 
 theoretically , there is no reason why the comparative method could not be applied to syntactic properties . however , there are two practical , very great , impediments : 1 . syntax dealing with word order , what is word order ? and further which word order in which environments ? e . g . : ich verstehe sie . ploetzlich verstehe ich sie . ( subordinating conjunction ) ich sie verstehe . un grand homme . un homme grand . ma chemise propre . ma propre chemise . 2 . how do we measure the difference ? how far is svo from sov ? from vso ? not only we do not know how to describe syntactic properties satisfactorily , but we do not know how to measure their differences , or , it boils down to the same , their similarities . now , you can validly argue that a binary scale ( same , different , and no shades of grey in between ) is good enough . remains that you do not reach valid comparisons on the basis of a single feature , but of many . if languages x and y have n identical features out of n , we are tempted to say that their syntactic similarity is n / n . but that is true if and only if each feature has the same weighting . on top of that , we do not even know what constitutes * one * feature . for instance , we may consider svo as consisting of two to three features : 1 . relative order of subject and verb 2 . relative order of verb and object 3 . relative order of subject and object where necessary to disambiguate . and further , how do we specify free sv order for instance ? via a ternary relation ( precede , follow , free ) , thus order = ( free , s , v ) or a binary relation ( precede , follow ) and a union , thus order = ( precede , s , v ) + ( follow , s , v ) ? too many questions unanswered , i fear even unaddressed . too many questions issuing from them . we cannot , i think , found a proper methodology on such shaky grounds . we 'd better be content with arguing futilely until we are blue in the keyboard . or else set about tackling those questions , a daunting task . j . guy @ trl . oz . au

blind of their ""intellectual Property""I'm gonna mail complaints@microsoft.com and get them to put an end to these
windows cd's ;--)Don't suppose you have a reference for it? I've made a lot of friends in the
MS complaints department, its amazing what you can say to them and get away
with it --::)))CWAnd no sorry I don't know the solution, they must be pretty bad quality
though if you can fit 25 albums on one CD. I would say they are Mpeg encoded
or some buzz like that. ---------------------
I've got some really interesting wav files here.A friend had a Windows CD with, wait for it . . .Every Beatles Record ever released in the U.K.! Including the Christmas and 
BBC special albums! All on one, ordinary CD! Yes a 650M CD!Of course this CD also had a special Windows app for playing this
collection!I had a look at the contents of the CD, since I don't do Windows, and the 
albums appeared to be plain wav files? Each album in it's own wav file, 25 
Albums, 25 wav files?!? I copied the wav files to my hard drive. Curious thing, though, noatun crashes on some of the larger ones, seems to 
attempt to load the entire file into memory first, and on the ones it
doesn't 
crash on, it plays them fast and noisily? kwave refuses to recognise them 
completely and wavp just makes an ungodly noise!xanim can, and does play them correctly though. Unfortunately xanim does nothave any position control so you just have to listen to the album from startto finish.file has this to say about them:johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ file beatles/SGT.WAV
beatles/SGT.WAV: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft ADPCM, 
stereo 22050 Hz
johngay@debian:/home/jgay$ ls -l beatles/SGT.WAV
-r-xr-xr-x    1 johngay  johngay  53334900 Sep 27  2001 beatles/SGT.WAVAnd this is SGT Pepper's lonely Hearts Club Band album. 51M is quite good, 
considering it also has the inner track. But they certainly are NOT in
stereo.What I would like to do is split up the tracks and convert them the mp3 for 
xmms. I'm jsut not sure what tools would be able to handle these strange 
compressed wav's that only xanim seems to recognise? I like the albums, but 
would prefer to be able to sellect tracks to play rather than entire albums 
and be able to listen to all my music with one app. I know xmms has a WAV 
plugin, but it does not recognise these either.Any help will be greatly appreciated!Cheers,	John Gay

case statement, which IMHO is cleaner than using an if statement if you
have a lot of branches... but then again maybe that should be refactored
away with polymorphism :)

lately I've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. I 
just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the 
scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.I checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000 
msgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:2.5-release: 350-450 msec
latest cvs: 1000-12000 msecFrankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the

 i have obtained a copy of a letter from representative tauzin and others to ferc chairman hebert which appears below . it could provide some indication of the direction ferc will take with the order it plans to issue next monday . summarizing , the letter calls for a comprehensive plan for price mitigation and monitoring within the entire wscc , which plan should :
 prohibit unnecessary outages and noncompliance with sales agreements ; refunds and penalties for charging rates not in compliance with the mitigation plan
 adopt market mechanisms ( rather than imposing rigid price controls ) and allow recovery of all verifiable costs
 promote conservation and demand response
 please see details below .
 june 12 , 2001
 the honorable curt h
 ? bert , jr .
 chairman
 federal energy regulatory commission
 888 first street , ne
 washington dc , 20426
 dear chairman h ? bert :
 since last summer , the committee on energy and commerce has closely
 monitored the electricity situation in california . today , the west
 continues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century , and
 california faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes again
 this summer . after extensive review of the energy crisis in the west ,
 including several hearings in washington and california , we recommend that
 the commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricity
 prices and keep power flowing into california .
 we recognize the commission ' s efforts in recent months to address the
 electricity crisis in the california and western markets , including measures
 to investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices . while we are
 pleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughout
 the west , we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesale
 electricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and the
 entire west in the hot summer months to come . to ensure that prices are
 just and reasonable during the critical months ahead , we believe the
 commission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity prices
 in western markets . we strongly urge the commission to implement a
 comprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitor
 wholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other market
 participants within the entire western systems coordinating council ( wscc ) .
 specifically , such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesale
 electricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout the
 wscc . the plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages and
 failures to comply with agreements to sell power . if the commission finds
 that a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan , it
 should strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to the
 full extent allowed by law .
 aware of the danger of discouraging supply , the commission has relied upon
 market - oriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that would
 exacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts . we share
 the commission ' s concerns regarding the need to encourage supply .
 accordingly , to prevent blackouts and contribute to a long - term solution ,
 the commission ' s comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms as
 appropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouraging
 availability of supply and investment in new generation and transmission .
 to mitigate prices and increase available supply , we also urge the
 commission to take every additional step within its authority to promote
 conservation and demand response throughout the western market . in states
 where retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs , consumers have less
 incentive to conserve . while demand reduction incentives are not a
 substitute for accurate price signals , a demand response program can
 encourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in parity .
 such a program should provide incentives and opportunities for both
 wholesale and retail consumers to sell , at market or other incentive prices ,
 "" foregone "" electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consume .
 specifically , the commission should : ( 1 ) establish or certify a wholesale
 "" clearinghouse "" for demand reduction agreements ; and ( 2 ) enable consumers ,
 whether individually or through aggregation arrangements , to sell foregone
 power to their own local distribution utility or to third - party purchasers .
 we recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demand
 reduction programs , but a broader , regional solution is needed to enable
 sufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer . we
 understand that such a program can be implemented without preempting state
 laws , abrogating existing contracts , or shifting costs to non - participant
 consumers .
 we look forward to working with you to build upon the commission ' s previous
 efforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices for
 consumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter . to ensure
 maximum relief to western consumers in the months ahead , we request that you
 take appropriate action consistent with our recommendations as soon as
 possible . we request that you respond to our recommendations in writing not
 later than the close of business on friday , june 22 . if you have questions
 please contact our staff . thank you in advance for your cooperation with
 this request .

0,"Hi,I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.htmlCould this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.Thanks for any opinions,
Ben

0,"Subject: re : 3 . 386 chomsky , mac concordance
 
 it seems to me that for whatever reasons , the fact that there are so many references to chomsky by non-linguists ( let 's ignore the linguists for now ) shows that the field is at least recognized as a legitimate area of intellectual inquiry - - ( after all , even oxford decided a few years ago that they should have a professor of linguistics - - after a long debate to be sure ) this is a cause for exhaltation - - not snyde remarks or comparisons to stalin and mao . and linguists of whatever stripe or theoretical persuasion should recognize that our newly recognized status is due to a great extent to the advent of generative grammar and chomsky . for various reasons i have met a number of nobel laureates over the last ten to fifteen years , and each one on learning i was a linguist asked "" do you know noam chomsky ? "" and each remarked at some point that he thought chomsky was one of the great intellects in history . a much better response than being asked "" how many languages do you speak ? "" while that may still be the layperson 's view of our field , it is no longer the view among scientists and academicians across the board . vicki fromkin

0,"Subject: mg intergration
 there are clearly a large number of people who need to know what is happening
 on the integration of the mg metals business and a large number of fluid
 teams working on different aspects of the project ; however , most issues
 related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of
 the people involved .
 we currently have two main forums for information sharing available to
 members of the integration team :
 the weekly newsletter produced by fiona grant in pr , which from 30 june
 onwards will be sent to eel management and the heads of those departments
 represented on the integration team .
 a weekly meeting on friday mornings from 8 am to 9 am in nwl 006 , which has been
 put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire
 integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and / or coming
 week .
 for now , i expect the weekly update and the weekly meetings to meet the
 information needs of the integration team . if you feel this is not adequate ,
 then let either myself or fiona grant know and we ' ll do a re - think on the
 subject .
 to this end , and in the interests of ensuring that we conclude our discussion
 in the allotted time , the following are a few organisational points i would
 like everyone to bear in mind when attending the friday morning meeting :
 attendees should distinguish between presenters and audience at the weekly
 meeting .
 presenters should attend if at all possible and , in the event they are unable
 to attend , should nominate a replacement for the meeting ( replacements should
 be notified to esther gerratt in advance of the friday morning meeting if
 possible ) .
 for the time being , presenters and their designated areas are :
 - eric gadd commercial and acquisition progress
 - amita gosalia eol
 - justin boyd legal
 - toby knight premises
 - barry sangster it infrastructure
 - bob campbell it applications
 - richard sage middle and back offices and project management
 - lloyd fleming rac
 - tim davies credit
 - anne edgley finance
 - anne hicks cash management
 - janine juggins tax
 - andrea kerch us gaap and due diligence
 - nigel sellens hr
 - fiona grant pr
 - bruce garner business development
 as this is intended to be an "" update "" - only meeting , any unresolved
 substantive issues are to be taken off - line and the resolution reported the
 following week .
 lastly , i would request that presenters focus on communicating , in an
 efficient manner , things which affect other functions within the integration
 process . doing so will assit other presenters in relaying the information
 presented at the meeting to other personnel in their respective areas .
 i hope you find this useful . we want to keep the information flowing as we
 continue the integration process , but at the same time we need to make sure
 we use our time wisely and efficiently .
 regards ,
 eric"

of the small deeply ethnic neighbourhoods, if you stray more than 50
feet from Wellesley and Jarvis or Queen and Spadina, you're in
doughnutland; there's far more like the eateries in the Eaton Centre
than there are quaint cafes like McCaul north of Dundas, and the rare
little eateries are not brimming with lunchtime traffic (you can still
find a seat at noon at Village by the Grange)When most of Toronto does not live in those neighbourhoods but instead
lives in Scarborough, Malton, Mississauga and Markham (franchisevilles), you
will quickly see that one or two trendy strips does not save an entire
nation.

( if you > do n't i ' ll say "" i thought not ! "" ) i suppose i ' m taking up benji 's gage , though i want it understood that i ' m very much in sympathy with what he has to say . i remember a little over 10 years ago i was taking a course in lexical phonology , and got into an argument with the prof . because he insisted that one of the co - rollaries of the theory was that ' people ' is inherently plural , which explained the non-existence of the overt plural ' peoples ' . i insisted that the word ' peoples ' certainly does exist and that therefore any theo - retical claim that it does n't was ipso facto falsified . ( cf . rev . vii 9 : ' a great multitude which no one could number , from every nation , from all tribes and * peoples * and languages ' . now , presumably ' people ' in this passage means something like ' ethnic group ' , and is not therefore precisely equivalent to ' people ' meaning ' many persons ' , or ' the set of all human beings ' . i would also note that one common meaning of ' universe ' is ' the set of all existing things ' , which would also imply that the word ' universes ' ought not to exist either , but it does . for one thing , there is a variant usage of ' universe ' which makes it roughly synonymous with ' galaxy ' or ' group of galaxies ' , of which of course there are many . it is also freely used in talking about ' parallel universes ' , etc . ) > from a paedagogical point of view i think it is perfectly legitimate for a linguistics teacher to say , ' here 's a bunch of strings , with attendant grammaticality judgments . what generalizations can we draw from these data ? ' we can save ourselves from the threat of the protest of a student who happens to be fluent in the language under discussion against a gram - maticality judgment by invoking the notion of ' idiolect ' and claiming ' these judgments are an accurate reflection of one particular individu - al 's own linguistic behaviour . what can we deduce about the internalized grammar of that individual ? ' this , of course , assumes that what we as linguists are concerned about is language as a psychological / cognitive phenomenon , and i believe that that is legitimate . but we are also , in my opinion legitimately , concerned about language as a social phenomenon . in which case language is not ( simply ) the property of an individual mind but of a community , and ' gram - maticality judgments ' may be different at the communal level from the individual level . i think as teachers we need to be honest with our stu - dents about this , which means allowing ourselves the luxury of a certain type or level of judgment on one occasion and a different one on another , but as much as possible each time making it clear to our students what level we ' re working at . addressing the broader issues that have come up following joseph stemberger 's posting in linguist 5-1163 , i think we also need to make clear the difference between ' grammaticality ' and ' acceptability ' judg - ments . i have an introductory lecture , prepared for a course i have as yet had no opportunity to teach , in which i attempt to explain that a given string ( e . g . , ' 3 is angry ' or ' my toothbrush is pregnant ' ) may be perfectly grammatical but semantically or pragmatically anomalous , and might be rejected for that reason , while another string ( e . g . , ' tooth - brush my am orange ' or ' there are a rabbit in garden ' ) may be fully in - terpretable and therefore not semantically anomalous but nevertheless violate certain constraints of grammar . i would be inclined to reject any claim that , as georgia green occasionally put it ( facetiously ) in class and elsewhere , ' the rules of grammar must include the rules of arithmetic and all other real-world knowledge ' . thus , if my son were to say , ' the moon is made of green cheese ' i might challenge him on the * content * of his statement , but not on its * con - struction * . dr . steven schaufele 712 west washington urbana , il 61801 217-344 - 8240 fcosws @ prairienet . org * * * * o syntagmata linguarum liberemini humanarum ! * * * * * * nihil vestris privari nisi obicibus potestis ! * * *

Hi, 
   I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like 
unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal 
from a server or just by using self md5 signature on the resulting 
executable.  I know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy 
problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard

 just want to give you a couple of updates .
 the prototype of the market penetration window was shown to jennifer fraser
 and chris gaskill yesterday . the overall response was very positive . based
 on this , it will provide a firmer estimate for delivery of phase i by the end
 of the week .
 the cost for the d & b data has been reduced by $ 100 k after additional
 negotiations . pursuant to that , the agreement was signed last week . the

 subject : global entelligence status
 just wanted to let you know a few updates :
 1 ) we have a full it team now ready to go . we are going to prototype the
 first window , market penetration . the prototype will give us something with
 sample data to show various traders to get additional feedback on
 functionality . hopefully , we will have something in 2 weeks .
 2 ) the previous cost estimates still stand until we have more feedback from
 the prototype . the estimates are $ 1 . 6 m for phase i and $ 1 . 6 m for remaining
 phases .
 3 ) included in the cost estimate is a figure of $ 389 k for the purchase of
 customer prospect data from dun & bradstreet . the $ 389 k is an o & m expense
 amount that was not included in the 2000 budget . this amount combined with
 other amounts ena did budget for or will spend with d & b results in an overall
 budget impact over the next 12 months of $ 278 k .
 i spoke with george wasaff in strategic sourcing this morning at the request
 of philippe bibi . george has some ideas for negotiating a better deal from
 d & b . either he will get more customer records for the price or negotiate
 better terms for a longer term on the recurring contract with d & b . this
 could take some time and push us late on getting the data scrubbed and ready
 to go for implementation . i believe i can give george some time to try
 something , but when it comes down to it , $ 389 k isn ' t that much money .
 therefore , i suggest that if we don ' t have anything negotiated in the next
 three weeks , we sign the current proposal from d & b and move forward . d & b
 is currently threatening ( a negotiation tactic , i think ) to pull their
 development resources off of this project until they receive a signed
 agreement . in the event this comes to pass and adversely impacts our
 delivery of global entelligence , we can provide a letter of intent to keep
 them moving or sign the proposal at that time .
 give me a call at 3 - 6079 if you have any comments on any of the above items ."

	3- The rest of the passengers
	4- The cabin and crew, who get a calcium substitute more

	5 (optional:) - Premium services and DRM for checked laptops.
They reactivate calcium channels and put the calcium back when
you arrive.  If you don't like it, you have to claim it as they put the
calcium back, subject to retries, and you have to remember the flight

Hash: SHA1Say 'amen' somebody. What the WSJ said, appended below.
The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,
expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at
the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the ""good""
of the city, and owned by an ""authority"" looking for something else
to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized
crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest
nation.Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago
have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally
irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in
government.As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly
usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will
be ""granted"" away  in a potlatch that only government, and
special-interest ""communities"", (or ""stakeholders"", or whatever the
cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize
to such perfection.
All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded
by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not
religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name.
*Commerce*.
If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites
who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects
on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called
""authority"" should disband itself and sell its property off to the
highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,
foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for
a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the
families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the
property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the
event.And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as
tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square
feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.
In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic
internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially
decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,
economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition
and statism.It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower
Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but
it's going to happen sooner or later.And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who
died at the World Trade Center.Cheers,
RAH- -------http://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.html
The Wall Street JournalSeptember 11, 2002
REVIEW & OUTLOOKA Living MemorialAs we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the
six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone
else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who
died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who
perished would be a living one.The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,
especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of
heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of
the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were
attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best
expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be
to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries
working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of
productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin
Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has
been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous
rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the
Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and
scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now
clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership,
and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance
to rebuild a better, more prosperous city.This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out
what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor
George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November
re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the
memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the
commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space
for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning
to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so
successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for
an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's
anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They
want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas
- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have
had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in
New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World
Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are
cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own
anti-development agenda in the name of ""honoring"" the dead. One
family group even called a press conference to reject as
disrespectful a proposed train line under the site.We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident
that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center
isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great
cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all
rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban
life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port
city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a
statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to
be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were
affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,
you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary
War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World
War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it
disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on
around the walls containing their names.In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the
emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future.
Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres
devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures
on the ""footprints,"" which, being in the center of the site, would
severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised
his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the
press and has since ducked for cover.Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe
those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking
more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best
way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

 ngi ' s daily gas price index
 published : october 17 , 2001
 ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacity
 given the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline .
 existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities .
 "" by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , "" the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] .
 existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . "" but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . ""
 given the lack of "" consensus supporting "" gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to "" resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , "" the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 .
 the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders .
 but the commission discounted these arguments . "" . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , "" the nopr noted ."

32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any Webpage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Â Â Â Â Â  It's true.
Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.Â  They'll
tell you it's true.Â  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.Â  They'll agree
100% that it's true.Â  Don't just take my word for it.
In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.Â  Really, they
can.Â  But, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
Â Â Â Â  One of those necessities is a website.
Â Â Â Â  Now, your website does one of two things...
Â Â Â Â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
Poor sales letters.
Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.Â  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.Â  Write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.Â  Why?
Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.Â  Keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) Use an illustration to get your point across.Â  In my
sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across Montana on a grizzly bear.Â  Leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.Â  Tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.Â  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""Â  It effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.Â  Your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.Â  Go back to the beginning of this article.Â  The first
words were, ""It's true.""Â  I can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
about.Â  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.Â  Carefully craft your first
line.Â  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.Â  Shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.Â  Hit them with your best shot.
Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.Â  By offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.Â  After all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) Just let it all flow out.Â  Write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
can edit it later.Â  If you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.Â  Write it ALL down.Â  Then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.Â  Edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) Make your sales letter personal.Â  Make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
yourself.Â  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""Â  Leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.Â  When you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.Â  It's a free service.Â  Make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) Write like you speak.Â  Forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.Â  Write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
Hemingway.
9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.Â  Use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
afraid to use short sentences.Â  Like this one.
Or this.
See what I mean?Â  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)Â  Stress the benefits, not the features.Â  Again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
forÂ  me?""Â  What need is it going to meet? What want is it
going to fill?Â  How is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?Â  Spell it out.Â  Don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
For example:Â  If you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.Â  So, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) Keep the reader interested.Â  Some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
understand.Â  Unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) Target your sales letter.Â  When you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.Â  For example: If you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.Â  Then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.Â  Write another
letter targeting senior citizens.Â  Still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.Â  The possibilities are endless.
All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
5 hours a week.""Â  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.Â  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
in a campus ezine.Â  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.Â  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.Â  Use short sentences
and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
Â Â Â Â  ...is to use a pause like this.
Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
HERE to continue.""
14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.Â  When the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""Â  Use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.Â  When you think of Superman, what
comes to mind?Â  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""Â  ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) Focus on one product or service.Â  Don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
confuses the reader.Â  Keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.Â  Then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) Make it stand out.Â  Don't kid yourself.Â  There are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.Â  How will you stand out among the
crowd?Â  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
breathe of originality.Â  Your product or service is
different. It's not like all of the rest.Â  It is unique.
Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.Â  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
Delete.Â  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
something?Â  Get real.Â  Don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.Â  You'll ruin your reputation.
Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.Â  Once you have been branded a liar, you will
NEVER be anything but a liar.Â  It doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.Â  Be believable.
Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
rather be EXACT.Â  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.Â  ""What am I really getting here?Â  Does he even know?""
When you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""This person must have counted.Â  I know exactly what
I can expect.""Â  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.Â  Answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.Â  Think about it from their point of view.
Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""Â  Then, address that
in your sales letter.Â  Remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.Â  Share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. Many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.Â  Satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.Â  ""If these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
probably will too.""Â  Especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.Â  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.Â  A well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.Â  They are
that important.
22) Avoid asking stupid questions.Â  ""Wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
you like to be as successful as I am?""Â  Avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.Â  By offering a free
item, you canÂ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.Â  By doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.Â  One of the things
that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
I am offering.Â  Ginsu made this one famous. They were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
and ""But that's not all.""Â  These phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.Â  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
value and benefits to the reader.
26) Always include a deadline.Â  By including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
bonuses.""Â  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
I've got to hurry.""Â  Let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
are very effective.Â  Every sales letter should have one.
27) Tell them exactly how to order.Â  Be clear as to the
order process. Point them towards the order link.Â  Tell
them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
etc.)Â  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)Â  Explain when the product will be delivered.Â  How
quickly will the order be processed?Â  When will the order be
available?Â  Let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.Â  The more specific you
can be here, the better.Â  Let them know that you have a
system in place.Â  ""Operators are standing by.""Â  Their order
will be handled properly.Â  Tell them.
29) Offer a money back guarantee.Â  Take away their last
reason to hold back.Â  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.Â  Most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.Â  You are REQUIRED to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.Â  Since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service RISK-FREE.
30) Instruct them to respond immediately.Â  Many people
just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""Â  ""Order today!""
""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""Â  You've got them
this far, now tell them what you want them to do.Â  Get them
to ""Act Fast!""Â  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
way?
31) Include a post script.Â  People will always read the
P.S.Â  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
parts of your sales letter. Why?Â  Because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.Â  A
P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. Use
your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
32) Include a second post script.Â  You better believe
if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.Â  Use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.Â  I guarantee you they will read it.
Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.Â  In fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

 32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any WebpageÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  It's true.
Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.Â  They'll
tell you it's true.Â  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.Â  They'll agree
100% that it's true.Â  Don't just take my word for it.
In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.Â  Really, they
can.Â  But, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
Â Â Â Â  One of those necessities is a website.
Â Â Â Â  Now, your website does one of two things...
Â Â Â Â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
Poor sales letters.
Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.Â  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.Â  Write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.Â  Why?
Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.Â  Keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) Use an illustration to get your point across.Â  In my
sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across Montana on a grizzly bear.Â  Leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.Â  Tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.Â  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""Â  It effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.Â  Your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.Â  Go back to the beginning of this article.Â  The first
words were, ""It's true.""Â  I can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
about.Â  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.Â  Carefully craft your first
line.Â  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.Â  Shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.Â  Hit them with your best shot.
Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.Â  By offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.Â  After all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) Just let it all flow out.Â  Write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
can edit it later.Â  If you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.Â  Write it ALL down.Â  Then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.Â  Edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) Make your sales letter personal.Â  Make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
yourself.Â  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""Â  Leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.Â  When you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.Â  It's a free service.Â  Make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) Write like you speak.Â  Forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.Â  Write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
Hemingway.
9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.Â  Use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
afraid to use short sentences.Â  Like this one.
Or this.
See what I mean?Â  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)Â  Stress the benefits, not the features.Â  Again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
forÂ  me?""Â  What need is it going to meet? What want is it
going to fill?Â  How is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?Â  Spell it out.Â  Don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
For example:Â  If you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.Â  So, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) Keep the reader interested.Â  Some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
understand.Â  Unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) Target your sales letter.Â  When you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.Â  For example: If you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.Â  Then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.Â  Write another
letter targeting senior citizens.Â  Still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.Â  The possibilities are endless.
All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
5 hours a week.""Â  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.Â  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
in a campus ezine.Â  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.Â  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.Â  Use short sentences
and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
Â Â Â Â  ...is to use a pause like this.
Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
HERE to continue.""
14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.Â  When the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""Â  Use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.Â  When you think of Superman, what
comes to mind?Â  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""Â  ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) Focus on one product or service.Â  Don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
confuses the reader.Â  Keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.Â  Then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) Make it stand out.Â  Don't kid yourself.Â  There are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.Â  How will you stand out among the
crowd?Â  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
breathe of originality.Â  Your product or service is
different. It's not like all of the rest.Â  It is unique.
Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.Â  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
Delete.Â  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
something?Â  Get real.Â  Don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.Â  You'll ruin your reputation.
Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.Â  Once you have been branded a liar, you will
NEVER be anything but a liar.Â  It doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.Â  Be believable.
Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
rather be EXACT.Â  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.Â  ""What am I really getting here?Â  Does he even know?""
When you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""This person must have counted.Â  I know exactly what
I can expect.""Â  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.Â  Answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.Â  Think about it from their point of view.
Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""Â  Then, address that
in your sales letter.Â  Remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.Â  Share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. Many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.Â  Satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.Â  ""If these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
probably will too.""Â  Especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.Â  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.Â  A well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.Â  They are
that important.
22) Avoid asking stupid questions.Â  ""Wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
you like to be as successful as I am?""Â  Avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.Â  By offering a free
item, you canÂ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.Â  By doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.Â  One of the things
that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
I am offering.Â  Ginsu made this one famous. They were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
and ""But that's not all.""Â  These phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.Â  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
value and benefits to the reader.
26) Always include a deadline.Â  By including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
bonuses.""Â  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
I've got to hurry.""Â  Let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
are very effective.Â  Every sales letter should have one.
27) Tell them exactly how to order.Â  Be clear as to the
order process. Point them towards the order link.Â  Tell
them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
etc.)Â  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)Â  Explain when the product will be delivered.Â  How
quickly will the order be processed?Â  When will the order be
available?Â  Let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.Â  The more specific you
can be here, the better.Â  Let them know that you have a
system in place.Â  ""Operators are standing by.""Â  Their order
will be handled properly.Â  Tell them.
29) Offer a money back guarantee.Â  Take away their last
reason to hold back.Â  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.Â  Most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.Â  You are REQUIRED to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.Â  Since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service RISK-FREE.
30) Instruct them to respond immediately.Â  Many people
just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""Â  ""Order today!""
""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""Â  You've got them
this far, now tell them what you want them to do.Â  Get them
to ""Act Fast!""Â  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
way?
31) Include a post script.Â  People will always read the
P.S.Â  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
parts of your sales letter. Why?Â  Because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.Â  A
P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. Use
your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
32) Include a second post script.Â  You better believe
if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.Â  Use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.Â  I guarantee you they will read it.
Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.Â  In fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:> Dear Sir/Madam,
> 
> May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
> solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science studentI guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.Jeremy

little embeded controller spoke to its DOS (not exactly the easiest

creating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it
extensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash
out for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my
predecessor's ""add new entries to the end of its linked list"" function
recursively called itself with each following link until the terminating

sure he felt he'd done a good days work when he planted that bomb for

0,"Subject: market maker simulation v . 2
 stinson and vince ,
 i finished the second version of the model which deals with open to close
 trading .
 the major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at open
 price which
 will affect the p / l .
 i also added the output features that john wants to see .
 the cumulative p / l is path dependent , the net open allowed seemingly has
 a strong influence on the cumulative p / l trajectory . ( the anomaly i
 discussed
 with vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further
 examination ) .
 could you review what i have done before we talk to john again ?

1,"Subject: re : check this out !
 
 dear friend , greetings ! hopefully my name is on the list below . i am a retired attorney , and about two years ago a man came to me with a letter . the letter he brought me is basically the same letter you havve in your hands . he asked me to verify that this letter was legal . i told him i would review it and get back to him . when i first read the letter i thought it was some off the wall idea to make money . a week and a half later we met in my offic to discuss the issue . i told him the letter he brought me was not 100 % legal and advised him to make a small change so it would be . i was still curious about the letter and he told me how it works . i thought it was a longshot so i decided against participation , but before my client left i asked him to keep me updated as to his results . about two months later , he called me to tell me he had received over $ 800 , 000 in cash ! i did n't believe him , so he suggested i try his idea to find out for myself . i thought about it for a couple of weeks and decided i had nothing to lose . i asked him for a copy of the letter and followed the instructions exactly , mailed out 200 copies and sure enough , the money started arriving ! it came slowly at first but after three weeks i was getting more mail than i could open in a day ! after about three months the money stopped coming . i kept a precise copy of my earnings and at the end of the three months they totaled $ 968 , 493 ! i was earning a good living as a lawyer , but as anyone in the legal profession will tell you , there is a lot of stress that comes with the job . i decided to try the letter again but this time sent out 500 letters . well , three months later , my earnings totaled $ 2 , 344 , 178 ! i just could not believe it , i met with my old client for lunch to find out how it worked . what made this one different from others were that there are six names on the list , not five like most others . that fact alone results in your name being on far more returns . the other factor was the help i gave him in ensuring the whole thing was legal , since nobody wants to risk doing something illegal . i ' ll bet by now you are curious to know what little change i told him to make . well , if you send a letter like this out , to make it legal you must actually sell something if you expect to receive something in return . so , when you send a dollar to each of the six people on the list , you must include a slip of paper with the words , "" please put me on your mailing list "" and enclose your mailing address . you need not include your name . this is the legal key to this program ! the item you received for the dollar you send the six names below is this letter and the right to earn thousands ! follow the simple instructions below exactly , and in three months you should receive over $ 800 , 000 ! ! ! $ 800 , 000 in less than 90 days ! ! ! guaranteed ! ! here is the business capital you need ! act now and be finacially solvent by the year 1999 ! ! this is a method of raising capital that really works every time , 100 percent . i ' m sure you could use the money in the next 20 to 90 day . s please study this carfully . this is not a chain letter ! this is a perfectly legal money making opportunity that will cost you a couple of rolls of stamps , a mailing list and six bucks . follow these instructions exactly and you will receive $ 800 , 000 in cash from business minded individuals just like yourself . 1 . immediately send $ 1 . 00 to each of the names below , and a note requesting you be added to their mailing lists . it is this important step that makes the system legal 2 . omit the name in the number 1 position and move each of the other names up one place ( number 2 becomes number 1 , number 3 becomes number 2 , 4 becomes number 3 etc . ) put your own name and address in the sixth position ( an easy way to do this is to type the six names , with your own name as number six , on a separate sheet of paper and tape over the area where the names are printed . ) 3 . print out 200 copies of these pages with the new list of names that you have created . your name now in the sixth position , in place of the current list of names . 4 . purchase a mailing list from the dataline co . or any other mail list sellers . most names list sell 200 names for only $ 26 . 00 . the best part is that the list of names come on self-adhesive labels that easily peel and stick to the envelope . just call 1-800 - 497-2912 . * * * mailing lists are also available from list associates at 1-888 - 359-2621 or mailing lists at 954-742 - 9519 . or check on the internet for other mail brokers . 5 . while waiting for the mailing list to arrive , place each of your 200 copies into business sized envelopes and seal them . go to the post office and purchase 200 . 32 cent stamps and place them on the envelopes . do not put your return address on the envelopes . . . this will peak the curiosity of the recipient . 6 . once your list arrives , place an address label on each of the 200 envelopes and drop them in the mailbox . within 20 to 90 days you will recieve over $ 800 , 000 in cash - and its all yours ! now comes the interesting part . . that 's with only a 7 . 5 % response rate ( which is very conservative . it 's more than possible to reach the amount every time ! ) the first time i participated my response rate was 9 . 5 % . my second was over 11 % 7 . keep this letter so you can use it as many times as you wish . using the addresses that people send you can raise the response rate because they also wish to conitine receiving more capital . * * this system was made for the purpose of accumulating capital fast and honestly . once again , this is not a chain letter , but perfectly legal ( refer to title 18 , sections 1302 and 1341 of the united states postal and lottery laws ) . when you send out 200 copies of this letter , each responsive individual sends out 200 copies and send you $ 1 . 00 , thereby multiplying your fortune very rapidly ! examine the chart of how this system is the best in america for raising capital ! ! ! * * you mail 200 letters , multiply that by 7 . 5 % return rate = 15 people + $ 15 * * 15 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 225 people = $ 225 * * 225 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 3375 people = $ 3375 * * 3375 people mail out 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 50 , 625 people = $ 50 , 625 * * 50 , 625 people mail 200 letters x 7 . 5 % = 759 , 375 people = $ 759 , 375 * * * at this point your name drops off the list , but so far you ' ve received $ 813 , 615 ! ! ! * be sure to mail $ 1 . 00 to each of teh six names on the list * 1 . john salinas 100 deseret dr . , pasco , wa 99301 2 . elizabeth potts 7714 west jenan dr , peoria , az 85345 3 . lavonda walton 4005 parkway apt . # 11 , temple hills , md 20748 4 . murry mcneal 316 rachels trail , st . peters , mo 63376 5 . joseph swenson 544 1 / 2 7th ave w . , kalispell , mt 59901 6 . suzy krogman po box 802167 , santa clarita , ca 91380 this system is guaranteed to work 100 percent of the time in raising capital , but , if you remove any other name aside from the one in the number one position , you will not be covered by the title 18 in the u . s . postal law . the best part about this is you won't be hurting anyone . it will take only about $ 100 to participate . it is legal , so make money honestly and start today !

0,"Subject: ellipsis in conjunction
 
 call for papers , focus group , zas , berlin , oct . 2 - 3 , 1998 workshop on ellipsis in conjunction in view of the growing interest in conjunction ellipsis this workshop is an attempt to promote the communication and bridge the gaps between different approaches within the framework of generative syntax . the workshop will concentrate on the following issues : ( 1 ) the structure of a conjunction construction . is the base-generated structure of a coordinate construction a double-headed structure ( williams 1994 ) , or does it have the second conjunct right-adjoined to the first conjunct ( reinhart 1991 ) , or is it a projection of a conjunction word ( &p ) ( munn1987 ) , or something else ? ( 2 ) the possible categories to be conjoined . must a conjunct be a clause or an extended projection ( excluding smaller xp - types ) ? must a conjunct be an xp ( excluding head and x ' ) ? and how are ' asymmetrical coordinations ' analyzed if only ' like ' categories can be conjoined ? ( 3 ) the analyses of ellipsis and gapping constructions . the verb gapping construction , for instance , has been analyzed as rightward np movement followed by an identical constituent deletion ( jayaseelan 1990 ) , across - the - board verb movement ( johnson 1996 ) , and deletion licensed in lf ( wilder 1997 ) . in addition , it remains to be shown how to account for the relationships between vp ellipsis , pseudogapping and gapping . furthermore , a general study of sluicing is required to cover wh in-situ languages where slucing does not alternate with an overt movement to eliminate strong features of a wh question ( lasnik 1997 ) . ( 4 ) the analysis of similarities and differences among various types of reduction . how and why do coordinative , comparative , and exception conjunction ellipses share properties and differ from each other syntactically , and / or semantically ? are the properties of forwad deletion and backward deletion related to lf and pf respectively , as claimed by wilder ( 1997 ) ? ( 5 ) the constraints on the ellipsis constructions . what are the language-specific properties that might interact with the representations of conjunction ellipsis ? are there any ellipsis or gapping rules in ug ? ( 6 ) the connection between conjunction ellipsis and information structure . to what extent are such ellipses determined by information structural aspects like focus background structuring ? ( 7 ) studies of conjunction ellipsis of a greater variety of languages . invited speakers : danny fox tilman hoehle kyle johnson jason merchant alan munn craig thiersch chris wilder organizers : kerstin schwabe , niina zhang , horst - dieter gasde , and andre meinunger the deadline for receipt of abstracts is july 1 , 1998 . please send your abstract ( 1 a4 / letter - size max ) to : dr . niina zhang zas jaegerstr . 10-11 10117 berlin germany tel : 49-30 - 20192572 fax : 49-30 - 20192402 email : ellipsis @ zas . gwz-berlin . de we accept abstracts by fax , email , as well as regular mail . the selection of the abstracts for presentation will be finished by the end of august . zentrum fur allgemeine sprachwissenschaft ( zas ) http : / / www . zas . gwz-berlin . de

TROUBLESHOOTING VOICE | By Tom LancasterWhen you're troubleshooting voice calls, particularly the signaling,
it's often helpful to look at the detailed output of the device, be
it a voice-enabled router, telephony server, gateway or whatever. 
This detailed output can be in the form of logs or debug output as is
the case in Cisco's IOS.  In any case, this output is likely to be
somewhat cryptic.  One of the reasons is because this output often
uses a set of standardized codes and it is simply easier to put more
information on the screen using a short number than it is to write an
essay about why some event happened.Read the entire tip at:

VoIP ENABLE YOUR TELEPHONY | By Tom LancasterOne of the reasons VoIP has been slowly gaining traction is that
large enterprises have quite a lot of legacy equipment, and migrating
to VoIP from the circuit-switched networks of yore is no easy feat.
These environments are typically complicated and the stakes are high
because so many mission-critical systems rely on telephony.Click here for the full tip:

UNDERSTANDING RELAY | By Tom LancasterEveryone knows that delay is one of the two primary causes of poor
voice quality, particularly in VoIP networks, but where does this
delay come from?  Delay is generally defined as the time it takes
from the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that
sound is regenerated on the far end. Quite a few things have to
happen to transport this sound through the system, so delay actually
has many components.Read the entire tip here:

 brent and sally ,
 after speaking with richard burchfield and brian hudson , i thought that it
 would be appropriate to update both of you and beth as to it ' s commitment .
 richard asked that he send out the message and i agreed . one reason for
 doing this was to show that the operations and it groups are working together
 towards a common goal . the other reason was to ensure that i had it ' s buy - in
 to completing this database in a timely fashion .
 our main goal will be to deliver the basic tools that any trading business
 would need and then to continue to develop the more advanced analytics in ql
 2001 . the actual roll out will happen in phases prior to january so that we
 begin the new year with a complete database which includes deal capture ,
 valuation , and the necessary reporting and accounting tools . by using brian
 hudson ' s it team i can be assured that the global needs are met .
 i will be in the office next week if you want to discuss this further ,

 todd ,
 per our discussion on moving forward with the development of a weather
 trading and valuation engine . i have discussed the high level requirements
 with joseph koothrappaly and have identified an it lead to manage the
 project . as discussed , the project will have the same project formula as the
 "" thunderball "" project with 3 - 6 month deliverables . also , the need to have
 co - operative development between houston and london will be established for
 global roll out of the weather system . the main focus will be a intranet
 trade capture and position with a callable valuation engine . the plan calls
 for phase i roll out for january 1 , 2001 . next steps will need to be
 discuss as soon as possible . topics that need to be addressed are definition
 of phase i , joint development between houston and london , and duel
 development between steve stock ' s valuation team and my trading team . keep in
 mind that though multiple teams will have development assignments , one person
 will manage the effort across teams .

0,"Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated 
with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be 
the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but 
related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", 
hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / 
G-Force Dyno-Staff.I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 
something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 
Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular 
seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some 
religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very 
irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and 
contrast with our (my) modern mental models.I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and 
justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.http://mindprod.com/methods.html

(Apologies for the embedded HTML.)We create the world we live in.
A loving person lives in a loving world,
A hostile person lives in a hostile world.
Everyone you meet is your mirror.You make yourself and others suffer just as much when you take offence 
as when you give offence. To be upset over what you don't have is to 
waste what you do have.The past is dead,
The future is imaginary,
Happiness can only be
in the Eternal Now MomentHow soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the 
direct experience that there's nothing you need that you don't have.Love a person because he or she is there.
This is the only reason.Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions 
and demands~ and you experience life as a parade of preferences.The
purpose
of our lives
is to be free
of all addictive traps,
and thus
become one
with the ocean of
Living Love.

i have a rpms that i have installed that i want to uninstall, i do it
like so:
rpm -e [rpm package]

so:
rpm -i [rpm package]

 recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 .
 volume issues :
 ? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day
 and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is
 received ) .
 ? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research
 is necessary as soon as possible .
 ? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of
 interconnect variances by day .
 ? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the
 system , eliminating manual line items on invoice .
 ? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding
 interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary
 correction .
 rate issues :
 ? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board .
 ? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily
 allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates
 from pg & e texas .
 ? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their
 invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this
 course of action .
 ? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so
 heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly .
 there are no open invoices in settlements .
 ? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per
 their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior
 to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between
 ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s
 verification .
 daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts
 to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena
 as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having
 to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk
 deal .
 he has not had a response from legal yet ."

0,"Subject: query : latin and romance
 
 the following hypothetical question has arisen in connection with what is possibly a real case of the same sort , but in another domain . suppose that latin had only occasionally been written down , and suppose that all latin texts , and indeed all knowledge of latin , had been totally lost long ago , apart perhaps from the odd place name or personal name , now of unknown significance . suppose further that only a single romance language had survived down to the present day - - say , galician , or gascon , or sicilian - - and that this variety had been written down for no more than four centuries and had never acquired any learned words from latin . in fact , to be on the safe side , let 's assume that the entire indo - european family had died out apart from this one romance language . now , suppose that a few fairly substantial latin texts happened to be dug up somewhere , none of them longer than about fifty words , with word-boundaries not systematically marked and the subject matter unknown ; these might have been written down over several centuries , but in no case later than the first century bc . knowing the alphabet , we would be able to read them at the phonological level , at least roughly , but at first the language would be utterly mysterious . so here 's my question . would it be possible for specialists in that last surviving romance language to establish that the recovered texts in fact represented an archaic form of that language , and would they be able to use their knowledge to interpret ( at least in part ) the texts themselves ? if anything turns up , i ' ll summarize the responses and explain what the point of this admittedly curious inquiry is . i ' m sending this query to both the linguist list and the ie list ; my apologies to those who receive it twice . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt @ cogs . susx . ac . uk

 i hope you do n't object to a complete stranger mailing you this , but i believe this to be an opportunity too good to be missed by anyone . i ' m looking forward to saving money on my phone bill and so can you : - to save money on your phone bill please read this message carefully tcw telecoms direct ltd least cost routing gives you the opportunity to save money on all of your phone bills all of the time . how much will you save ? local calls 15 % regional calls 30 % national calls 30 % international calls 30 % landline to mobile 10 % ( discounts shown are against bt standard rates . rates track bt on a daily basis , for pricing information see bt ) now here comes the best bit - you can save even more every month by referring friends . simply tell your friends about the tcw lcr service . give them your customer number ( located on the top left of your contract when you have become a customer ) ( call 01235 442350 and quote account number de / 184374 to become a customer yourself ) ask your friends to call tcw telecoms direct ltd on 01235 442350 . let tcw telecoms direct ltd do the rest . how will tcw thank you ? you ' ll receive credits for every month that your recommended friends continue to use the tcw service . every month there will be a loyalty referral discount on your bill . the more friends you refer , the greater your monthly credit will become - and yes - this credit is every month . so become a tcw customer now and then call your friends . in time , your phone bill from tcw telecoms direct could read zero ! how do you become a tcw customer ? call tcw telecoms direct ltd on 01235 442350 now and give them the account number de / 184374 - you , me and your friends will soon be saving money on your phone bills - even more so if you all recommend the service to others . good luck and here 's to smaller phone bills for everyone ! ! more details follow for those wishing to know more about how this service works if you are already receiving discounts from bt or your cable operator , you may not see the benefit of using the tcw service as the discounts above may not seem attractive . however , remember that by recommending friends your resultant discounts over bt standard rates could become 100 % every month due to the referral credits appearing on your tcw bill . in other words , by recommending friends you can reduce your tcw bill to zero over time . i have just asked tcw / telecoms direct customer service what happens to calls to numbers such as 0845 that get used for internet access , and apparently these are discounted the same as local calls , i . e . 15 % ( or more when you recommend friends ) . please call them yourself to confirm on 01235 442350 . what is least cost routing ? least cost routing is a system designed to save you money on all your local , regional , national and international calls as well as calls to mobile phones . why is least cost routing allowed to exist ? least cost routing is relatively new in the uk and has come about since the government passed a bill to deregulate the national telephone system . this ended the bt monopoly , allowing tcw telecom direct to offer you a highly competitive service with substantial discounts on your calls . how does it work ? least cost routing works by simply re-routing your calls through tcw 's billing system . it does this via a free "" smart box "" that attaches to your phone and bt or cable socket . in other words , you keep your existing telephone number , dial as normal , and receive exactly the same high quality service . you will then receive a bill from your existing telephone company for line rental and maybe some specialised calls and another bill ( lower than before ) from tcw for your local , regional , national and international calls as well as calls to mobile phones . your combined bill will , of course be lower . effectively nothing changes , but the total price you pay . the "" smart box "" is plugged into your existing bt or cable wall socket which is used for the majority of your calls . your phone is then plugged into the "" smart box "" . you then use your phone as per normal and save money . if there is heavy usage from another extension , you may consider requesting a second smart box . there is no minimum contract period . what will your bill from tcw show ? fully itemised call details with number of calls , type of calls ( local , regional , national , international , mobile ) , duration of calls , cost of each call , how much the calls would have cost without least cost routing .

===============================Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships
shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians sayWASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been 
charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding 
government-issued credit cards?(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.(b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.(c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf 
membership.(d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river 
rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert.(e) all of the above.""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said Steve Dasbach, 
Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal 
government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, 
the military has launched a raid on your wallet.""The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office 
audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly 
unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 
2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax 
credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees 
carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 
billion in goods and services, the audit found.In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and 
government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, 
then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to 
supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their 
travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a 
strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling 
suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, 
take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, 
reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the 
worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even 
imagine.""Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury 
cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and 
armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.
 
Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit 
noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can 
be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" 
such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates. Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of 
documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, 
so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.
  
""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat 
Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse 
taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said.
 
""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard 
against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to 
force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, 
instead of offending the taxpayer.""

 subject : ferc conference on el paso capacity allocation ( rpo 0 - 336 )
 summary
 though this conference was scheduled to review all issues related to el paso ' s capacity allocation method ( including those in the pipeline ' s order 637 proceeding ) , and with two complaints filed this summer regarding problems with the pipeline ' s allocation , major substantive issues were not covered at this conference . for instance , the battle between full requirements ( fr ) shippers and contract demand ( cd ) shippers came up marginally , but not in terms as substantive as the proposed conversion of fr shippers to cd contracts .
 procedurally , there was also no decision on whether to proceed with a hearing , merits decision from the commission or settlement , though it looks like a merits decision is the likely avenue for a decision . staff did not discuss case merits or ask pointed substantive questions .
 allocation studies ( models )
 el paso opened the conference with a presentation / interpretation of seven capacity studies they have done to illustrate how its allocation proposal ( march 27 ) would allocate the system ' s receipt and delivery points based on different scenarios . for nominations , receipt and delivery points were specified and ranked by shippers , and the model used 20 pools . the scheduling model looked at where constraints occurred ( based on those shipper - supplied preferences ) , solved the largest constraints first , then ran second and third iterations to complete allocation .
 there were questions on the studies , what they show , what the assumptions are , etc . , and in the end shippers believe they need information not shown by the completed studies . shippers have requested six more allocation studies , showing possible impacts of seasonalization ( winter and summer ) and the difference between cd and full requirements coincidental and non coincidental peaks ( winter and summer , 1995 - 2000 ) .
 el paso interprets its studies as showing that the proposed capacity allocation method is workable , and in fact results in 247 mmcf / d of unallocated capacity ( 230 mmcf coming from the line 2000 expansion proposal , and an extra 17 mmcf ) . shippers were skeptical of the "" slack capacity "" finding .
 other issues
 ? pooling : there was a small amount of discussion on the impact of moving from six to 20 pools . it was noted that this should be addressed with order 637 issues , expeditiously after capacity allocation method is resolved .
 ? fr vs . cd : though there were some fr vs . cd shippers discussions , they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by the tx , nm and az shippers ( fr ) and aera energy ( cd shippers ) . there was also no mention of converting fr shippers to cd service . note : never mentioned were the cd and fr complainants ' proposals that el paso ( 1 ) dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or ( 2 ) requiring mainline system expansion for existing service ( rpol - 484 and 486 ) .
 ? release shippers : shippers contracting for released capacity were concerned about how they would be allocated , as well as those shippers picking up turnback contracts from the pipeline ( which would have receipt and delivery points already allocated ) .
 ? receipt point designation : the question was asked if shippers could designate specific receipt points rather than pools . when asked what commission policy is on pools vs . receipt points , both shippers and staff clarified that they are neither mutually exclusive nor to serve as substitutes for one another - both should be available . however , staff noted that in the flexibility vs . reliability debate , it could be argued that el paso should return to receipt point designation to maintain reliability .
 procedure going forward
 the primary issue here ended up being procedural .
 the procedural schedule is as follows :
 ? el paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing : sept . 24
 ? initial comments ( on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations ) : oct . 15
 ? reply comments : oct . 26"

 louise : i spoke with rick buy yesterday about improving our monitoring controls over potential assets that we might own due to some residual claim or "" clawback "" that enron retained when the primary asset was disposed , i . e . midwest gas storage . while we don ' t have hundreds of these situations , i am aware of several deals where we retained overriding royalties , exploration options , calls on cash flow after certain debt is paid off , etc . hopefully , most of these have been captured in our compliance system but as illustrated with midwest , our system does not appear airtight .
 therefore , i propose that we immediately review all of our current and disposed portfolio for any "" hidden "" assets or claims that have not been properly captured . additionally , we will shore up our monitoring procedures where necessary . one of our deliverables will be to provide you and other members of senior management with a list and description of potential assets .
 in addition to rac , i would like to have participation from the commercial and legal side on our review team and suggest that perhaps dick lydecker ' s group would have the appropriate resources .
 i would appreciate your concurrence and feedback at your convenience . regards , rick c ."

There are many more whoe only have one partner over ""long""
periods of time. So it is far from ""vacuous"" to describe some
people as ""promiscuous"" and others as ""not promiscuous"", 
especially over a set period. (""He was promiscuous in college.
He is no longer promiscuous."")The word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency 
to gloss that meaning over with population averages. > >Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females.

pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him ""Wilt"",
also has sex with the other 499,999 women. 499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have
only had one partner. It is now ""perfectly obvious"" that in the
common meaning of the term, among this contrived population, 
that women are ""more promiscuous"" than men -- even though the
single ""most promiscuous"" person, Wilt, is a man.  ""Promiscuity"" is not ""exactly, perfectly identical between males 
and females"", except under a degenerate custom definition of
""promiscuity"".> >unless ""promiscuity"" is defined uselessly.
> 
> Ain't nothin' useless about averages.Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their 
actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.- Gordon"

 subject : price caps

 enron .

 new cap specifics
 on 10 / 26 / 2000 the iso board passed a motion by a vote of 13 - 10 to implement a
 new price cap methodology .
 the new methodology will become effective 11 / 3 / 2000 or as soon thereafter as
 can be implemented . caiso staff has indicated that it will be difficult to
 achieve that start date . they have not yet indicated what an achievable date
 might be .
 the new price cap methodology will remain in place until :
 comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven
 to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions .
 either ferc or the iso board orders its removal .
 cap prices will be based on the average nymex l 3 d settlement average and the
 following heat rate table :
 load level heat rate 4 . 00 gas example cap
 40 gw $ 250 / mwh $ 250 / mwh
 caps will be rounded up to the nearest $ 5 / mwh increment .
 demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps .
 the iso will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior
 to the beginning of each calendar month . based on the iso ' s two day - ahead
 system load forecast , the iso will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior
 to the hour of delivery .
 ferc context
 ferc has delegated cap authority to the caiso until 11 / 15 / 2000 .
 the iso has asserted that they don ' t need ferc authority since it is a bid
 cap rather than a sales cap . ferc regulates sales , not purchases , of
 electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices .
 the iso has filed with ferc for an extension of the price cap authority .
 ferc has to rule on the filing by 11 / 18 / 2000 . ( note that this is 3 days
 after their authority expires )
 ferc will release its proposed order on 11 / 1 / 2000 based on the results of its
 206 investigation of the california wholesale power markets . we don ' t know
 what they will find or what they will propose .
 the proposed order will have a 30 day comment period , after which ferc will
 likely issue a final order . ferc will be accepting oral comments on
 11 / 9 / 2000 in washington . enron still has to determine who will provide oral
 comments .
 many companies have filed at ferc advocating or opposing a litany of price
 caps , cost based rates , and market redesign recommendations .
 it is likely that the price caps approved by the iso board will go into
 effect . how long they will remain in effect will depend on whether ferc
 extends the iso price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from
 the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy .
 impact of price caps
 the attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at
 different gas price levels . we think that this is the highest that markets
 would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap . it is hard to
 say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap
 because we don ' t know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the
 cap . the assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below .
 take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000 .
 calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load , new
 price cap methodology , and a range of gas prices .
 divide historical hours into peak and off - peak buckets .
 calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off - peak hours .
 for example , we have two years worth of data for the months of january
 through september . each month has approximately 400 hours . for january
 through september , we took approximately 800 observations for each month ( 400
 from each year ) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual
 observations .
 we created a peak table and an off - peak table . the table shows the
 calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices
 for each month . this value represents what the month would clear at if each
 hour cleared at the cap ( based on historic loads ) . while any given hour
 could be above this value , our calculation estimates the likely monthly
 average cap value !
 the blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current ( 10 / 27 / 2000
 nymex ) forward prices . the yellow shading indicates those forward power
 prices which are in excess of the proposed cap ."

as mine). There's no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones.Currently on release dwd2, which I'm using on my home rawhide box.
(Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production
boxes).Now... Does anyone know of a good way to delete ""old"" RPMS from a
directory containing both ""new"" and ""old"" RPMS? Say I have
blurb-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm, blurb-0.1.0-2.i386.rpm, and
blurb-0.1.1-1.i386.rpm, and want to remove the blurb-0.1.0-* because of
the presence of blurb-0.1.1-1? Anyone have a convenient script?Dave.

 4th international cognitive linguistics conference july 17 - july 21 , 1995 , albuquerque , new mexico * aims and scope the international cognitive linguistics conference offers a forum for research within the perspective of cognitive linguistics . this perspective subsumes a number of concerns and broadly compatible theoretical approaches that share a common basis : the idea that language is an integral part of cognition which reflects the interaction of cultural , psychological , communicative , and functional considerations , and which can only be understood in the context of a realistic view of conceptualization and mental processing . topics of interest for cognitive linguistics include the structural characteristics of natural language categorization ( such as prototypicality , metaphor , mental imagery , and cognitive models ) , the functional principles of linguistic organization ( such as iconicity and naturalness ) , the conceptual interface between syntax and semantics , the experiential and pragmatic background of language-in - use , and the relationship between language and thought . in addition , topics of special interest for the 1995 conference include cross-linguistic studies and cognitive linguistic approaches to signed language research . * conference site the 1995 conference will take place on the campus of the university of new mexico ( unm ) in albuquerque . albuquerque lies between the foothills of the sandia mountains ( with peaks of more than 10 , 000 feet ) and the west mesa ( which is dotted with the cinder cones of long-extinct volcanoes ) ; dividing the city is the winding rio grande valley , famous for its bosque nature preserve . at an altitude of roughly 5000 feet , the university campus enjoys warm summer days and cool nights . excursions to nearby pueblos , santa fe , and the sandia mountains are being planned . also taking place at unm during the summer of 1995 is the linguistic society of america 's biennial linguistic institute . under the direction of joan bybee , li-95 will run for six weeks from late june to early august and will include over 50 courses taught by visiting faculty as well as special lectures . the conceptual structure for li-95 applies cross-linguistic comparison and a functional orientation to the major areas of linguistics and the language emphases of the university of new mexico program : signed languages , spanish , and native american languages . several other conferences are planned to precede and follow the 1995 icla conference . * submission of abstracts authors are requested to submit four copies of a one-page abstract in hardcopy format to the address below . abstracts must be received before november 30 , 1994 . authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by february 1 , 1995 . sherman wilcox / icla95 department of linguistics university of new mexico albuquerque , nm 87131

Date: Not suppliedJohn Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising
[1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet 
gold rush. Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that 
advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a 
product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where 
consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first 
rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our 
immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. 
And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead 
of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.[1] http://jrobb.userland.com/stories/2002/09/11/trustbasedAdvertising.html

Falling asleep at the wheel is no laughing matter. Still, it kinda
happened with yesterday's
tip. I forgot to mention that the String value's label
is ""Logging"" (sans quotes). That was almost like a cliffhanger,
eh? The oversight was totally my fault. I've been thinking about
asking Gretchen and Brian to help with future reviews. Don't be
surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure you'd welcome a female
perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our landlords
pick a paint color for the ""office"" wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the
Internet? You betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and
rugs. I have a feeling I'll be the one tweaking furniture layout.
Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet. I wonder if Ikea has an
affiliate program?I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but
did you know that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If
you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,
something may get lost in the translation. Try sending this
sentence: ""My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate.""
Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will
surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit
Marion Schroll for making me aware of the ""problem."" It's kinda
funny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I
send changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:
what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and
they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's throw
away.I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: ""What is
this crazy business with the broadband metering? What they
advertise doesn't seem to be what you get. Now that I'm forking
out $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320
up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not sure what
I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure
if I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me
out here? I'm feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig
is full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT
I was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to
ask?"" It's not too much to ask the question, but it's probably too
much to get the answer. I'm facing the same dilemma right now,
even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my area.
Expect more and more ""filters"" to be put in place as time marches
on. Watch those EULAs, folks.See You in August,Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Chris PirilloÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â

As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.
Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREEhttp://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an ""Under Construction"" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of ""Lord of the Rings""...Recommend It!

SQLView v2.1.0.20 [5.2M] W9x/2k/XP FREEhttp://mywebpages.comcast.net/fredbubbers/software/{View ODBC Output} SQLView is ""A SQL Database viewing utility. (It) automatically detects all available ODBC data sources and displays them in an explorer-like tree. User(s) may double-click on data sources to access the databases, browse tables, execute custom queries and export (the) data to .CSV or .XML files."" I didn't really have much on my machine to throw at this program. However, the one data source I did have (mostly related to Music CD creation) displayed perfectly in SQL View.

CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20
    Unearthed by Shawn Verrallhttp://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp
 
{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as ""The Bar."" It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar, and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the first place, that is.

Â GnomeTIPI am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

 car rental options for enron travelers
 rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to :
 national car rental ( primary ) and alamo rent - a - car ( secondary ) .
 the intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage enron ' s total
 car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non - pricing
 provisions ( i . e . insurance ) .
 national car rental , due to its service levels , availability and total value
 proposition , has been awarded primary status and is recommended as the first
 choice for enron travelers ' needs .
 alamo rent - a - car , a sister company to national , has been awarded a contract
 reflecting a secondary status , due to its service levels , availability and
 low cost solutions . alamo is recommended as an alternative to national ,
 where available .
 when you rent a vehicle in the united states , ( including puerto rico ) or
 canada , the following insurance provisions are included , regardless of rate
 selected :
 1 . l / dw ( loss / damage waiver ) - this is what is called comprehensive or
 collision on your personal auto . it covers the rental vehicle and pays for
 any damage to it .
 2 . liability - this covers people and property outside the rental vehicle .
 for both national and alamo , the coverage is $ 100 , 000 per person , $ 300 , 000
 per occurrence and $ 50 , 000 for property damage .
 * * important * * *
 these coverages apply regardless of rate selected , as long as the following
 contract id is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded
 on the transaction rental agreement . ( national - 5000838 alamo - # 143974 )
 to enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from enron ' s
 preferred suppliers , it is recommended that each traveler enroll in
 national ' s and alamo ' s preferred traveler programs . national ' s emerald club
 membership and alamo ' s quicksilver program are designed to speed the
 transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid
 return . the enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for enron
 travelers . enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of enron
 american express t & e cardholders . you may also find an enrollment form on
 the enron travel program intranet @ gss . enron . com .
 if you have any questions or comments , please contact jeff leath at

 i am working for joe gold and my group is concerned with adding the web as an

 through the web we are also able to convey a more local image , rather than
 presenting ourselves as a texan company through enron . com .
 to set you into perspective about what we have in mind i have attached a
 brief presentation which has been the basis for the sign off of the project .
 we intend to display a wide training section for the following reasons :
 document our know - how base
 educate the market participants
 generate great stickiness ( participants should know that if they need to know

 later on : have the option to commercialise this area .

(e.g. by using a wget cron job), symlink the needed rpms and recreate the

them .08.  I just waited to see how many times they'd mail me a notice.  7 
times by the time I left and paid them the .08.  Funny thing was, I lived 
right behind the office where it was mailed from.  (:

 review of : arboreal for windows , cascadilla press . by dr . matthew crocker ( mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk ) centre for cognitive science , university of edinburgh . arboreal for windows ( henceforth , arborwin ) is a package designed to facilitate drawing trees within microsoft ( tm ) windows ( tm ) applications . arborwin consists simply of a truetype ( tm ) font in which keys are mapped to tree component shaped characters rather than standard keyboard symbols . the advantage of drawing trees in this way is that arborwin is very portable , and can be used in any wysiwyg windows ( tm ) application which allows you to select specific fonts ( i . e . most ) . the disadvantage , broadly , is that ` type-setting ' or layout of the trees is left to the user . the ` characters ' of arborwin include left , right , vertical , and ` triangle ' branches - - each of several widths ( but all the same height ) . the font is also fully scalable . in general , i found that arborwin behaved as intended , given that it is simply a font-based package . its most basic limitation is that there is a relatively small selection of branch sizes ( i . e . how narrow or wide a branch is ) . in practice , the most common problem i encountered was that ` triangle ' branches ( eg , for phrase without internal structure ) could n't be made wide enough . . . given that one often wants to put fairly long phrases under these . the only way to increase the width was to increase the point size for the branch ; but this also increases the height of the particular branch , and makes trees look disproportionate and inconsistent . being font-based , however , also means it cannot attain the flexibility of alternative packages ( eg , the ` tree ' package for latex ) . the ' tree ' package , for example , takes as input a declarative tree specification ( as a bracketed list ) and then automatically typesets the tree , and also permits crossing branches , and upside-down trees . since typesetting is automatic , the tree formatting is consistent , and tailored to the size / length of terminals ( including the triangle branches ) . overall the package is simple to use and quite effective if your requirements ( in terms of both sophistication , and layout quality ) are not too demanding . if greater flexibility , consistency , and quality is required , then i believe there is still no substitute for latex and its associated packages . dr . matthew crocker , esrc research fellow centre for cognitive science university of edinburgh mwc @ cogsci . ed . ac . uk

0,"Subject: calculating bid - ask prices
 this is about enron movie trading business where we are a market maker for
 trading future of a movie ' s gross box office receipt . rich sent to many
 people a writing explaining his movie trading idea and asked us to provide
 some feedback .
 i think the idea ( see below ) might be applicable to other parts of enron . we
 can call it "" dynamic bid - ask price process "" .
 in fact , we can set that the bidding period is closed when no new bid is
 submitted to the system within a specified amount of time . the final
 ( clearing ) bid and ask prices are just the last "" tentative "" price shown to
 the public before the bidding period ends . ( so the customers can see the
 final price before the market close and can revise their bids if they wish . )
 i think this method is suitable for illiquid products to be traded via
 enrononline . com .

 subject : calculating bid - ask prices
 i think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to
 forecast it . otherwise , if our forecast is not consistence with the market ,
 we may have an imbalance in the bid - ask orders and we may end up taking some
 positions . you know , as russ and martin pointed out , we cannot fight with the
 studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the
 price easily .
 one way to ensure the balance of the bid - ask orders is to embed an exchange
 system inside our bid - ask prices front end . each week , we have a trading
 period . during the period , instead of posting bid - ask prices , we post
 "" tentative "" bid - ask prices , then we ask our customers to submit their
 acceptable buying or selling price . these "" tentative "" bid - ask prices get
 updated and are shown to the public . of course , customers can revise / withdraw
 their bids anytime during the trading period . at the end of the period , we
 calculate and post the final bid and ask prices . the seller who submits lower
 selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price . the buyer
 who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask
 price . next week , we repeat the same process .
 this way , we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a
 broker where we don ' t take any position at all . we make profit from those
 bid - ask spread . we don ' t have to worry about forecasting accuracy and
 insiders ' trading because we don ' t have to take any position . let the market
 be the one who decides the price .
 if we maintain our net position as zero , at the end , when all the actual
 gross box office numbers are reported in those publications , our customers
 with open long / short positions are perfectly matched . using the
 mark - to - market charge can reduce credit risk .
 thanks ,

 subject : some more input
 hi rich and key ,
 again i think your idea is very good . i think that we , as a market maker , can
 reduce our credit risk ( risk of default ) if we do the "" mark - to - market ""
 charging . that is , each week when we release a new expected value of the
 gross box office receipt , we balance all the opening positions the same way
 as in a regular future market . this way , we can give margin calls to the
 couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money .
 in the last paragraph , i think the gross box office can also be determined
 from the market itself ( i . e . , if there are lots of buyers , our offer price
 should go up . )
 we can offer other derivative products such as options as well .

 2001 - 11 - 29 12 : 30 ( new york )
 washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - following are comments
 made this morning by senate majority leader tom daschle when asked
 about the collapse of enron corp . :
 ` ` we ' re certainly going to try to find answers to
 the questions involving the collapse of enron . i don ' t know that
 anybody knows yet just how this happened and how it happened so
 quickly .
 ` ` i think we need to find as much information as is possible
 and make some assessment about whether it ' s indicative of energy
 in a larger context and if it is , what we ought to do about it .
 but clearly it raises some very serious questions . ' '
 enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed
 2001 - 11 - 29 12 : 25 ( new york )
 enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed
 houston , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - trammell crow co . delayed
 construction of a $ 108 million office development in downtown
 houston , the first real estate project in the city to suffer the
 fallout from enron ' s financial troubles .
 trammell crow delayed groundbreaking on the planned 34 - story
 tower until at least next year , said leah rogers , a trammell crow
 spokeswoman . construction was to have started next week .
 ` ` given the national economic uncertainty and the uncertainty
 associated with the future availability of class ` a ' space
 springing from the recent events at enron , we have decided to
 delay our construction start until future visibility improves , ' '
 matt khourie , who heads trammell crow ' s houston development
 operations , said in a statement .
 enron , the largest u . s . energy trader , may have to file for
 bankruptcy protection and liquidate assets after dynegy inc .
 abandoned its proposed purchase of the company , investors and
 analysts said . with enron expected to give most of the 3 million
 square feet it occupies in houston , developers will have a harder
 time filling projects , forcing rental rates down , brokers said .
 about 2 million square feet of enron ' s space is in the city ' s
 downtown , where trammell crow ' s ballpark place project was
 planned . the project was to include apartments and retail space ,
 and sit next to enron field , home to the major league baseball
 team houston astros , according to the houston chronicle , which
 reported the delay earlier .
 houston has 4 projects under construction , including a 40 -
 story , 1 . 17 - million - square - foot tower being built by enron next to
 its current headquarters . the projects are mainly being built for
 power companies , said peyton collins , head of property broker
 insignia / esg ' s houston office .
 ` ` the downtown market is 5 percent vacant and if you look
 five years out , with all the space that ' s coming in line , vacancy
 rates could double , ' ' said collins .
 other houston office projects underway include an 800 , 000 -
 square - foot building in which reliant resources will lease 550 , 000
 square feet , and a 600 , 000 - square - foot tower , half of which will
 be occupied by calpine corp . , according to insignia .

 newpower has enough cash to run through 2 nd quarter ( updatel )
 ( updates with financing details in second paragraph and
 enron ' s third - quarter loss on investments in sixth paragraph . )
 purchase , new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - newpower holdings
 inc . , a venture formed by enron corp . to compete with traditional
 natural - gas and electric utilities , said it has enough cash and
 credit to run through the second quarter .
 the company is negotiating with lenders for $ 50 million for
 next year and another $ 50 million in 2003 , spokeswoman gael doar
 said . newpower , 44 percent owned by enron , may need money to buy
 gas for winter inventories next year , she said .
 newpower said a possible enron bankruptcy filing probably
 won ' t affect its earnings . the purchase , new york - based company
 said it can meet its credit obligations to enron and utilities and
 will continue to deliver to customers .
 newpower had 805 , 000 customers at the end of the third
 quarter and said it expects to have 840 , 000 to 860 , 000 by the end
 of the year . most electricity customers are in texas . georgia is
 its largest gas market , doar said . it also has business in ohio ,
 pennsylvania and elsewhere .
 dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its bid for rival enron , once
 the biggest energy trader , after standard i ' m sure i can expect some of
 that sort of stuff but nothing yet today . i ' m sure they ' ve got

 ( adds margin increases in fourth - fifth paragraphs . )
 new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - new york mercantile exchange
 president j . robert collins told floor members they could not
 accept orders from enron corp . unless they receive written
 authorization from an exchange clearing member .
 a fax from collins to member firms today said the order was
 effective immediately and that it would ` ` remain in effect until
 further notice from the exchange . ' '
 clearing members are companies that guarantee transactions on
 the exchange , which trades energy and metals futures and options .
 the exchange yesterday said it will raise margins on its
 natural gas and crude oil futures contracts at the close of
 trading today . margins are deposits traders must make with the
 exchange when buying or selling futures contracts to ensure
 obligations will be met .
 while the exchange gave no reason for the increase , the
 decision followed a day of wide changes in natural gas prices . the
 swings began after dynegy inc . abandoned plans to purchase enron ,
 once the biggest gas trader . traders grew concerned that enron
 might be forced into bankruptcy .

 london , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s metals unit , one
 of the biggest traders on the london metal exchange , is close to
 being sold , its administrator said , an accord that would end an 18 -
 month foray into markets for copper and similar products .
 possible buyers include hsbc holdings plc , glencore
 international ag and the current management of the company ,
 traders and analysts speculated . officials at the companies
 couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment .
 ` ` there is already very serious interest in enron ' s metal
 business , and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful
 deal ' ' soon , said tony lomas , a pricewaterhousecoopers
 administrator for enron in europe . ` ` our primary focus will be on
 the large physical assets and trading position of the group . ' '
 traders and analysts have speculated that enron metals would
 be sold since dynegy inc . agreed earlier this month to buy enron
 corp . for $ 23 billion . after that accord collapsed yesterday , the
 metals unit seemed slated for a sale , analysts said .
 enron agreed to buy the business , formerly mg plc , for $ 445
 million in may of last year . mg itself was the metals - trading unit
 of germany ' s metallgesellschaft ag and a century - old operation
 upon which that german construction , engineering and trading
 company was built .
 it is one of just 11 floor traders on the london metal
 exchange , the world ' s biggest metals bourse . enron earned
 commissions though brokering trades there , charged rent at its
 warehouses owned by henry bath & son ltd . and speculated on the
 direction of metals prices .
 declining market
 the former chief executive of metallgesellschaft , heinz
 schimmelbusch , in an interview earlier this month denied
 speculation that his pennsylvania - based safeguard international
 fund lp was interested in buying enron or any metals - trading
 operation .
 hsbc , europe ' s biggest bank by market value , said last month
 it ' s considering a plan to add trading of industrial metals such
 as copper and aluminum to its precious - metals trading operation to
 meet demand from its customers .
 any interest from glencore may stem from its desire to expand
 its existing operations , said mike price , head of mining and
 metals at societe generale , which is itself a so - called ring
 dealer , or floor trader , on the lme .
 whoever buys enron metals ` ` has to be somebody pretty
 substantial , ' ' price said . if the current management hopes to be
 the buyer , ` ` they would need to find somebody with deep pockets . ' '
 the new owner of enron metals will be entering the metals
 market at a time when copper prices have declined 15 percent this
 year and aluminum prices are 7 percent down as demand dropped from
 users such as aircraft makers and electronics companies amid
 slowing economies .
 the declining prices have led n . m . rothschild & sons , a
 member of the lme , to quit base metals trading and prompted
 scotiamoccata , a metals - trading unit of canada ' s bank of nova
 scotia to leave the lme ring .
 the departure of scotiamoccata reduced the number of ring
 dealers to 11 and raised doubts about the future of open - outcry
 trading at the exchange . the lme is promoting less - expensive
 electronic trading .
 german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million
 2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york )
 german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million
 frankfurt , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - dresdner bank ag , which is
 owned by allianz ag , said its exposure to enron corp . is about
 $ 100 million .
 deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag said their exposure to
 enron amounts to a ` ` double - digit ' ' million euros amount .
 europe ' s largest bank has an exposure ` ` significantly ' ' below
 100 million euros ( $ 89 million ) , said ronald weichert , a spokesman
 for deutsche bank .
 commerzbank ' s exposure is more than 10 million euros and less
 than 50 million euros , spokesman peter pietsch said .
 dresdner expects ` ` way less ' ' than $ 100 million to default ,
 and will take the appropriate loan loss reserves at the end of the
 year , said spokeswoman elke pawellek .
 the largest u . s . energy trader , may file for bankruptcy
 protection after dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed
 merger with enron , forcing enron to liquidate assets to pay some
 of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt .
 enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case
 2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 04 ( new york )
 enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case
 washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is poised to
 file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history after dynegy
 inc . scuttled plans to acquire the energy trader that is saddled
 with more than $ 15 billion in debt .
 enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week ,
 must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is
 responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated
 partnerships .
 the houston - based company ' s collapse was underscored by new
 restrictions on its operations . the new york mercantile exchange
 barred floor members from accepting orders from enron without
 special written authorization , and the company ' s internet trading
 was reduced from about 30 commodities to three products .
 a bankruptcy filing by enron would top texaco inc . ' s record
 $ 35 . 9 billion case in 1987 , with creditors lining up to claim
 what ' s left of the company ' s more than $ 61 billion in assets .
 ` ` it ' s a black hole , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of
 deltec asset management llc , which has no investment in enron .
 ` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things
 out , you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth . ' '
 duke energy corp . , j . p . morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and
 a dozen other companies say they may lose more than $ 1 billion
 combined from enron ' s collapse . electricity and natural gas
 companies said enron owed them almost $ 600 million as of
 yesterday .
 in london , was appointed administrator
 of enron ' s european holding company and some of its operating
 companies , a step other companies have taken before filing chapter
 11 papers in the u . s .
 enron shares have lost more than $ 26 billion in market value
 in the last six months .
 lawyers
 enron has hired the law firm weil gotshal & manges llp , which
 has the nation ' s largest bankruptcy practice , and the blackstone
 group lp investment banking firm . arthur newman , head of
 restructuring at blackstone , said his firm was retained but
 declined to comment further .
 chapter 11 would let enron officials continue to control the
 company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . a
 provision of u . s . bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt -
 collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the
 company .
 ` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved
 company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean
 of the university of houston law center .
 thousands affected
 an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people ,
 including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers ,
 suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised
 recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies
 and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in
 the company ' s liquidation .
 in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a
 nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns
 portland general electric , which generates and distributes power
 to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s
 enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic
 communications network .
 chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous
 contracts and unprofitable leases .
 ` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away
 from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also
 publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations .
 recovery
 the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a
 company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan
 typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing
 two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a
 bankruptcy judge for final approval .
 the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various
 classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy
 code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their
 claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as
 bondholders and suppliers .
 financial advisers to creditors and companies in large
 bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be
 particularly difficult to produce .
 ` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass
 of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a
 bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard &
 zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for
 advice by enron bondholders .
 shareholders
 enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their
 investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line
 to get paid .
 enron shares fell 20 cents , or 33 percent , to 41 cents in
 afternoon trading . the shares traded at $ 54 . 54 on june 4 . the
 company said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a
 scheduled 12 . 5 - cent quarterly dividend on dec . 20 .
 enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty about the
 company ' s value . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in
 2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said .
 at that price the notes yield 53 percent .
 some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may
 come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker
 with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for
 advice by enron bondholders .
 ` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky .
 potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers
 and directors .
 ` ` disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization is going
 to be a painstaking job , ' ' he said .
 liability
 dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase
 of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave
 it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the
 takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in
 exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco
 corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy .
 enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking
 away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline .
 the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was
 proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5
 billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the
 lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s
 decision .
 bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b .
 lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors
 turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be
 able to pay its debts .
 three credit - rating agencies yesterday cut enron ' s credit
 rating to junk status , triggering an acceleration of the company ' s
 debt obligations .
 unraveling
 enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said
 shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the
 way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the
 announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s .
 securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating
 earnings for almost five years .
 as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence
 the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners
 such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or
 restricted trading with the company .
 ` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s
 going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up
 being an unsecured creditor tomorrow . ' '
 enron ' s overseas assets could complicate bankruptcy

 dow jones emerging markets report
 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
 new york - ( dow jones ) - as enron corp . ( ene ) teeters on the edge of insolvency , its creditors , power industry players and even foreign governments are angling to lay claim to the company ' s assets .
 in an example of how far the ripples are being felt , the brazilian government said thursday it ' s legally entitled to seize enron ' s assets in that country if the u . s . energy titan files for bankruptcy .
 the houston - based company has more than $ 60 billion in assets , a little more than 10 % of which are considered "" non - core "" or located overseas . indeed , of enron ' s 10 , 453 megawatts in total power production , 8339 mw are generated internationally .
 as it established a presence in dozens of countries , enron also diversified into oil and gas exploration and production , power generation , and even non - energy related businesses such as forest products , metals and steel , broadband and credit evaluation systems .
 although enron ' s non - core and global forays haven ' t on the whole been profitable , there is value in some of the hard assets .
 and while it ' s not clear whether or how claims by foreign governments on enron assets would be honored , it ' s certain the company ' s myriad overseas holdings will further addle what would likely be a vastly complex bankruptcy proceeding .
 the following is an overview of a number of those holdings outside the north american continent , according to some of the most recent data provided by the company , which didn ' t , however , specify the extent of its equity interests or operational control in the majority of the assets listed .
 approximately 70 % of enron ' s assets outside north america and europe are located in central and south america and the caribbean :
 - - - brazil : enron controls electricity distributor elektro eletricidade e servico sa ( e . eko ) , which was acquired in 1998 for brrl . 479 billion ( $ 1 = brr 2 . 48 ) . it also owns two gas - fired thermoelectric plants : eletrobolt , with a capacity of 380 megawatts , and cuiaba , with a 480 - mw capacity .
 enron also owns important stakes in natural gas distributor companhia distribuidora de gas do rio de janeiro ( e . cdr ) , or ceg , and its smaller unit ceg - rio .
 in late april , brazil ' s oil giant petroleo brasileiro ( pbr ) , or petrobras , agreed to pay $ 240 million for the stake enron owns in ceg . petrobras agreed to buy the 25 . 38 % stake the u . s . energy group owns in ceg as well as the 33 . 75 % stake enron has in ceg - rio . the deal is still seen closing in the next few days .
 - - - puerto rico : enron has been poised to sell in the weeks ahead a 49 % interest in the 507 mw ecoelectrica power plant and liquified natural gas terminal for about $ 250 million .
 it ' s also involved in a 20 , 000 metric ton liquefied petroleum gas storage terminal and the san juan gas distribution company , which has a capacity to carry approximately 400 , 000 cubic feet a day .
 - - - bolivia : enron is an operator on the bolivian side of the 3 , 000 kilometer bolivia - to - brazil natural gas pipeline , and holds a small 4 % interest on the brazilian side .
 - - - argentina : enron has an interest in transportadora de gas del sur , a 5 , 005 kilometer pipeline .
 - - - venezuela : enron , in cooperation with vengas , is involved in a leading transporter and distributor of lpg , among other assets .
 - - - colombia : enron has stakes in the centragas pipeline , a 578 km natural gas transmission system , and promigas , a top natural gas company .
 - - - panama : enron holds a 355 mw electricity generation plant .
 - - - guatemala : enron has two power plants with combined generating capacity of 234 mw .
 - - - dominican republic : enron has a 185 mw power facility .
 the company also has a sizeable footprint in asia , particularly in india :
 - - - india : about 14 % of enron ' s international assets are located in india , home to its mammoth $ 3 billion dabhol power project , which has a generation capacity of 2184 mw .
 enron is also poised to sell its offshore india oil 201 - 938 - 2226 ; charles . roth @ dowjones . com

 usa : ice electronic energy trade soars on enron woes .

 reuters english news service
 ( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
 new york , nov 29 ( reuters ) - the intercontinental exchange ( ice ) , an atlanta - based electronic energy and metals marketplace , said on thursday that trade on its system in late november was up 65 percent from october .
 ice has been setting new trading records in recent weeks , as concerns over energy trader enron corp . ' s crumbling credit rating diverted on - line business to the exchange .
 enron suspended operations of enrononline , ice ' s main rival for internet - based trading , on wednesday after standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating to "" junk "" status , killing a potential takeover by dynegy inc . .
 enron , which said it has no plans to permanently dismantle its electronic trading system , said it reopened enrononline thursday to allow parties to unwind outstanding positions .
 until this month , enron was by far the nation ' s largest trader in north american natural gas and electricity , with industry analysts estimating it was involved in some 25 percent of all daily trade in those markets .
 in addition to increased volumes , ice has also seen a big jump in the number of users tapping into the system , up 30 percent from october , the exchange said in a statement .
 "" over the past couple of weeks we have experienced an increase in total volumes and registered users , "" said jeffrey sprecher , chief executive officer of ice .
 "" we believe the inherent credit concerns in the otc ( over - the - counter ) market have spawned interest in a many - to - many trading platform as opposed to a one - to - many platform .
 sprecher also said ice would continue to look for ways to expand its trading platform to accommodate new participants .
 as an open - access marketplace , intercontinental exchange now has over 400 commodity trading firms participating .
 the ice electronic trading system is now installed on over 7 , 500 desktops worldwide , a 7 percent gain in the past two weeks .
 products traded on ice include natural gas , power , crude oil and refined products , precious metals and emissions allowances .
 intercontinental exchange has offices in new york , houston , chicago , london and singapore and is owned by over 100 energy and metals traders , brokers and bankers .

 uk : uk prompt electricity dives on enron backlash .
 11 / 29 / 2001
 reuters english news service
 ( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
 london , nov 29 ( reuters ) - british day - ahead electricity prices slumped on thursday as traders dumped power onto the market after cutting ties with troubled enron .
 day - ahead electricity was trading down to 15 pounds per megawatt hour from 26 . 5 pounds on wednesday .
 "" certain parties have cut lines with counter parties and have ended up having to dump electricity on the market , "" said one trader .
 the electricity flooding the prompt market is power which would have gone to enron and is likely to be generated from plants which cannot easily be switched off , such as nuclear power stations .
 enron ' s european business was placed into administration on thursday as its parent stands on the brink of bankruptcy after a rescue deal with smaller rival dynegy fell apart .
 in forward curve trading prices for the summer 02 baseload contract finished 10 pence higher 17 . 39 pounds and winter 02 baseload was down ten pence at 19 . 25 pounds , traders said .
 traders said companies could start terminating contracts with enron under the terms of the over - the - counter market ' s standard gtma contract . a clause in the gtma allows immediate termination should a counterparty become insolvent .

 new york - ( dow jones ) - trading in u . s . natural gas and electricity markets generally remained orderly thursday , and price movements continued to be muted , despite the exit of one - time market leader enron corp . ( ene ) .
 some gas markets , however , saw more volatility as a result of enron ' s absence , traders said , and some electricity prices seemed stronger than justified by fundamentals , perhaps a result of buying by traders covering their exposure to enron . the moves weren ' t dramatic .
 "" it ' s almost business as usual , "" one power trader said .
 enron wasn ' t presenting a full range of prices on its internet - based platform enrononline thursday , although traders said enron was briefly making markets for some products .
 traders , who for the most part aren ' t doing business with the company , attributed the activity to last - minute efforts by some energy companies to flatten their positions with enron and the energy giant ' s own efforts to close its positions .
 "" there ' s a lot of unwinding going on , "" a trader said .
 the new york mercantile exchange , the world ' s largest energy futures exchange , advised its floor members thursday morning not to accept orders placed directly to the trading floor by enron or enron affiliates without written authorization from a clearing member carrying an enron account .
 the exit of a company that once accounted for a quarter of the north american power and gas markets has produced substantial changes in the way business is done in the energy markets .
 traders used to transacting on enrononline were spending more time on the phone or turning to platforms like that run by , an electronic marketplace founded by a consortium of energy and financial companies . traders accustomed to looking to enrononline for pricing guidance were left to figure out the market for themselves .
 the result was abnormally high volatility in the physical gas markets , particularly on gas for delivery in the next month , a trader said .
 gas for delivery in december at southern california ' s topak hub was trading in a range of $ 1 . 95 to $ 2 . 55 per million british thermal units , the trader said . december gas at the san juan basin was trading at $ 1 . 70 - $ 2 . 44 .
 "" traders aren ' t sure where they should be trading , "" the trader said .

 ( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
 san francisco , nov 29 ( reuters ) - beleaguered energy giant enron corp . said on thursday it had reopened its widely used electronic trading system to allow parties to unwind outstanding positions .
 the company also said it has no plans to permanently dismantle its enrononline ( eol ) system , which until this month was by far the most liquid marketplace for trading north american electricity and natural gas .
 "" enrononline is now available to our customers to transact only in order to provide a means to manage enron credit exposure , "" a message posted on the trading system said .
 the message warned that "" while transactions may be available , customers entering into transactions should carefully evaluate their positions and enron ' s current credit status before transacting . ""
 enron spokesman eric thode confirmed enrononline - which recently accounted for up to 60 percent of enron ' s business - restarted operations late wednesday .
 the internet - based eol trading platform was shut earlier wednesday after credit rating agencies cut enron ' s debt to "" junk "" status .
 thode also said the company had "" no plans "" to cease operations on enrononline after parties have closed all outstanding positions .
 the system also carries products for trading various commodities like metals , pulp and paper .
 enron is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy after a rescue deal with its smaller rival , dynegy inc . , fell apart on wednesday .

 frankfurt , nov 29 ( reuters ) - german electricity prices jumped around widely on thursday , while year 2002 firmed by up to 35 eurocents due to uncertainty over the value of long - term contracts with crisis - hit counterparty enron .
 enron ' s liquidity crisis reached a head on thursday when the firm announced that its european arm had filed for creditor protection .
 "" prices were jumpy today , which was in part due to uncertainty with enron , "" a trader said .
 "" but enron has actually been tapering off its volumes further out for a while now , so the market didn ' t really miss any big volumes from them today , "" he added .
 day ahead baseload traded at 31 . 5 - 33 euros , with an early high of 35 euros and a mid - session low of 29 . 5 euros , while peakload traded at 39 . 75 - 42 . 25 euros , after peaking at 45 euros and troughing at 39 . 75 euros .

 year 2002 firmed to 22 . 75 from 22 . 4 euros , before falling back down to 22 . 45 and last traded at 22 . 35 - 55 .

 berlin - ( dow jones ) - while some european mutual funds may be stuck holding enron inc . ( ene ) shares or bonds , their exposure appears fairly limited , with a number of fund companies saying they already sold off their holdings in recent months .
 nevertheless , a few funds said they had some exposure in stock or bonds to the company , which stopped most trading wednesday after standard & poor ' s downgraded its credit rating to "" junk "" and dynegy inc . ( dyn ) abandoned plans for a buyout .
 fund manger helle bendorff with bg invest in copenhagen said at the end of october , bg invest ' s international corporate bond fund had 6 . 1 million kroner , or 3 . 2 % , invested in enron corporate bonds , out of a total fund of dkkl 95 million ( $ 1 = dkk 8 . 3652 ) .
 "" naturally when something like this happens anyone can see it will take its toll on returns , "" said bendorff . however , she wouldn ' t give further details .
 enron ' s 4 3 / 8 bonds dated 2005 were trading around 20 cents to the dollar thursday , down from over 50 cents before the buyout fell through . the collapse of the dynegy deal leaves enron bondholders holding about $ 13 billion in debt versus an unknown base of assets .
 analysts widely expect enron to file for insolvency protection , and its liquidation value will be the focus for bondholders . bondholders are therefore more likely to get something back than investors who are left holding stocks .
 in contrast with u . s . counterparts , most european stock funds ' exposure appears fairly low , however , and any hit to their value was probably already taken in the last months .
 fund managers and spokespeople at a number of european fund houses that had been known to have holdings in enron shares in the past said they sold off those assets in recent months and weeks .
 a spokesman at dutch funds company ohra beleggingen beheer bv said the fund sold its enron holdings at the end of october . they had comprised around 4 . 7 % of its eur 20 million new energy fund and were also included in some other funds , according to funds tracking company morningstar . he said they took a loss on the investment , but stressed they still unwound their holdings on time .
 a fund manager at denmark ' s uni - invest said the firms electronic business unit trust had sold off its holdings in enron prior to the current troubles . as of the end of september the unit trust had held 3 . 6 % of its assets in enron stock . the size of the unit trust is dkk 585 million , the manager said .
 dresdner bank ' s dit funds arm also sold off all its enron holdings in its energie fonds after the company ' s third - quarter earnings report , a spokesman said , as did ubs ' ag ' s ef - energy fund .
 european energy funds tend to be rather small , so even if the fund is highly exposed , it ' s unlikely to have any market impact . the largest energy funds are only several hundred million euros , for example .
 in the u . s . , the picture was somewhat different .
 enron may have been held by some major u . s . funds , according to the funds ' most recent securities and exchange commission filings . those include fmr corp . ' s ( x . fin ) fidelity investments , stilwell financial inc . ' s ( sv ) janus capital corp . , alliance capital management ( ac ) and putnam investments . vanguard group inc . ( x . vgi ) held the stock in various portfolios , including its giant passively managed index funds , according to its filings .
 the $ 11 billion alliance premier growth fund had about 4 % of its assets in enron shares as of sept . 30 , according to morningstar . based on the sept . 30 filing , the fund ' s stake had dropped in value by about $ 445 million through wednesday . a spokeswoman for janus said the company ' s mercury fund , which had 3 . 6 % of its assets invested in enron stock on april 30 , had disposed of all its enron shares by mid - november .
 many of the stock funds in europe that are still holding enron funds also reduced their weightings considerably in recent months , according to their representatives .
 a spokesman for u . k . - based investec said the company is still holding some enron stock , but wouldn ' t give specific data . morningstar listed the global privatization fund and the wired index fund as holders of enron stock , but investec ' s web site doesn ' t list the funds in the top 10 holdings .
 "" our enron positions in each of these funds is less than 3 % - it ' s a non - material exposure . we cut our loss positions about two months ago , and we were underweight even before that for a year now , "" he said . "" the wired index fund tracks the wired index ( a u . s . new - economy index ) and enron is a constituent of that , so our holding is the constituent portion . ""
 separately , standard and poor ' s said enron will be removed from its sdow jones newswires ; 49 - 302888410

 enron metals trading staff say bnp , coke metals , hsbc rumoured possible buyers

 ( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
 new york ( afx ) - enron corp ' s metal trading division has sparked some interest from potential buyers with rumours from the company ' s own trading floor putting bnp paribas , coke metals group , hsbc banking group and goldman sachs & co inc in the frame , an enron metals trader said .
 he added that employees have not yet received any information from management on the future of the troubled energy giant following news from london this morning that enron ' s european office has gone into administration .
 "" everybody showed up for work today , it ' s still a working entity but we ' ve had no word , no internal memos as yet , "" the employee told afx news . "" we ' re completely in the dark . ""
 according to reports , an official from administrator has said there is strong interest in the company ' s metals trading division , sparking speculation within the company of potential acquirers , he said .
 parties rumoured to be interested in acquiring the division include bnp paribas , coke metals , hsbc and goldman sachs .
 "" enron still has a membership of the london metals exchange which is of interest to banks who want to get back into the business , "" said the employee , who requested anonymity .
 "" it ' s not the only asset that would be of interest though . the pipeline and fact that ( enron ) has warehousing should be worth hundreds of millions of dollars . ""
 enron , which employs a total of 21 , 000 people , has been flooded with phone calls all morning from customers seeking information on the company ' s plans .
 "" for now , we ' re still optimistic that a solution will be found and we won ' t lose our jobs , "" said the employee .
 analysts are expecting enron to file for bankruptcy protection after dynegy inc yesterday terminated their merger agreement and the company ' s ratings were reduced to junk status .
 the stock , which lost 85 pct of its value yesterday , has been forced out of the s & p 500 .

 usa : dynegy cites deterioration in enron operations .
 11 / 29 / 2001
 reuters english news service
 ( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
 houston , nov 29 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . chairman and chief executive chuck watson on thursday said disclosures by enron corp . of further deterioration in its operations led dynegy to pull out of a deal to acquire the beleaguered energy trading giant and keep it afloat .
 a nov . 19 filing with regulators showed that enron faced insurmountable problems both in the long term and the short term , causing dynegy to invoke "" material adverse change "" clauses allowing it to pull out of its agreement to acquire enron , watson said in an interview with cnbc television .
 announcements on wednesday by credit - rating agencies that they had downgraded enron debt to junk status also played a key role in dynegy ' s decision , he said .
 watson said dynegy is confident that it will take control of enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline unit next month under a clause of the acquisition agreement that allowed it to keep the 16 , 500 miles of pipeline if the deal collapsed .
 enron has said it will contest dynegy ' s claim to the pipeline .

 ( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
 washington , nov 29 ( reuters ) - u . s . senate majority leader tom daschle said on thursday that congress should find out what brought one - time energy giant enron corp . to the brink of bankruptcy , and see if it has broader ramifications for the energy industry .
 "" we certainly need to try to find answers to the questions involving the collapse of enron , "" the south dakota democrat told reporters .
 "" i think we need to find as much information as possible , and make some assessments of whether it ' s indicative of energy in the larger context and if it is , what we ought to do about it . but clearly , it raises some very serious questions , "" daschle said .
 activity at many enron units in more than 40 countries around the world ground to a halt this week . the global giant employs 21 , 000 people in operations ranging from marketing electricity and natural gas to delivering commodities such as metals , coal , pulp and paper .
 house energy and commerce committee chairman billy tauzin said on wednesday he did not see a way for the government to try to rescue enron , which was near collapse after rival energy trader dynergy inc . pulled out of a deal to buy it .
 "" i can ' t right now envision anything the government can do , other than encourage the parties who are discussing a merger to continue their efforts , "" said tauzin , a louisiana republican .

 enron crisis hits four japanese money mgmt funds - nikkei

 dow jones international news
 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
 tokyo ( nikkei ) - - the reverberations of the crisis at u . s . energy trading giant enron corp . are starting to shake japanese investors , the nihon keizai shimbun reported in its friday morning edition .
 with enron now on the edge of bankruptcy , money management funds managed by nikko asset management co . and three other fund companies fell below their par value of yl 0 , 000 thursday due to losses on enron bonds .
 the money management funds have apparently fallen 0 . 5 % to 7 % under par value , a significant loss of principal given that the funds total more than y 3 trillion in size .
 japan has experienced two previous cases of money management funds falling under their face value , but the losses were smaller in scale .
 the four fund companies are being besieged with redemptions by nervous investors anxious to retrieve their money . nikko asset management , for example , has reportedly received requests for redemptions totaling more than yl trillion out of a total fund balance of y 2 . 7 trillion .
 japan investment trust management co . and sumisei global investment trust management co . , two of the other firms hit by losses on enron bonds , also received redemption requests equivalent to nearly 30 % of total fund assets . the fourth firm affected was ufj partners asset management co .
 jittery investors , meanwhile , are asking other fund companies , even those not affected by the enron crisis , to disclose their asset holdings in money management funds .
 in response , shinko investment trust management co . has drawn up plans to send to brokers materials disclosing all holdings in its money management fund and a medium - term government bond investment fund .
 daiwa asset management co . is also considering ways to beef up disclosure for what is the largest money management fund in the industry .
 analysts and industry executives are expressing concern that the declines below the par value could cause investors to rethink the safety of money management funds . these funds have been marketed as ultrasafe investment vehicles and a good alternative to bank deposits when a cap on deposit insurance protection is reimposed in april next year . with interest rates continuing to languish at extremely low levels , some fund managers have been tempted to add riskier corporate bonds to their holdings in an attempt to pump up fund yields .
 money management funds had more than yl 8 trillion in assets as of the end of october , accounting for about one - third of assets in all investment trusts .

 enron bonds signal anticipated enron bankruptcy filing

 ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
 new york - ( dow jones ) - the corporate bond market is signaling its anticipation of an imminent bankruptcy filing by beleaguered energy services company enron corp . ( ene ) .
 there is a 22 - 1 / 2 bid both for bonds maturing in 2003 and 2009 . and neither bid is with accrued interest .
 the combination of the bonds trading without accrued interest , or flat , and the withering of the normal gap in price between shorter - and longer - dated maturities means the market believes "" the company is probably going into bankruptcy , "" said tom haag , senior analyst in charge of distressed securities , lutheran brotherhood , minneapolis .
 by trading flat , investors are saying that they do not expect to receive any further interest payments from enron . and the sameness of price , regardless of maturity , signals that the market believes all the bonds will be treated the same in a bankruptcy proceeding , said haag .
 normally , bond prices reflect greater risk of repayment for longer - dated maturities .
 on wednesday , before standard & poor ' s and the two other major ratings agencies downgraded enron to speculative grade from investment grade , enron ' s 7 - 7 / 8 % coupon bonds maturing in 2003 were being offered at a price of $ 59 with accrued interest , traders said .
 after the downgrades , prices fell into the 20 s but the bonds were still quoted with accrued interest , said harold rivkin , principal , h . rivkin 201 - 938 - 2008 ; michael . barr @ dowjones . com

   Version: 1.2.1
   File size: 2.38MB

   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X   Cartoon Editor won't turn you into a gifted cartoonist
   overnight. But what this graphic editor will do is make quick
   work of creating short QuickTime movies and animated GIFs--

   Cartoon Editor lets you draw or import JPEGs and GIFs, which
   you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you
   group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful
   cartoony things. The program's Java2D foundation allows for
   some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,
   antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.   http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=6b-8g5ZIHEcOAstO5H80ywQ-4d0P6cR    Want to review Cartoon Editor? Submit your opinion here:

 on friday , an absolutely massive gain of over 375 % for investors who got in
 early . face it , some of these small sto \ cks really move !
 let ' s look at today ' s featured company , sounds 24 - 7 , inc . ( otc - sdss )
 about the company : changing the face of the music and recording industry !

 million new cd titles produced annually . today , as in yesterday , music sales
 continue to be driven by the consumer first hearing the music as a prelude
 to the purchase of music . the consumer now supplements his / her tradional
 radio listening with tens of thousands of other radio stations . sounds 24 - 7
 of / fers ins - t @ nt access to all stations , all music with the largest catalog
 of music anywhere that is building to the availability of multi - millions of
 tracks of songs . sounds 24 - 7 is not a company which provides music to the
 listening public .
 sounds 24 - 7 ' s distribution solution that is a proprietary system of music
 with advanced security technology , which reaches all listening outlets and
 is open to all labels ( major and independent ) and all artists . the major
 labels are of ` fered access to sounds 24 - 7 ' s distribution system at zero
 cost , without any changes to the rules of usage and only pay , if they so
 choose , for playtime reporting . radio stations and club djs receive sounds
 24 - 7 at zero cost . independent labels and artists pay a nominal fee to be
 included in sounds 24 - 7 ' s library .
 in the weeks and months to come , sounds 24 - 7 will be building revolutionary
 and profitable relationships with the labels and artists as sounds 24 - 7
 build what will become the largest library of music available anywhere . at
 the same time , credentials and passwords will be allotted to radio stations
 and club dj ' s , but only after they are screened for legitimacy . all these
 relationships will be carefully cultivated to result in maximum
 effectiveness for all concerned .

 call for papers distributing and accessing linguistic resources workshop immediately before the first international conference on language resources and evaluation ( lrec ) , may 27 1998 granada , spain http : / / www . icp . grenet . fr / elra / conflre . html short description : this workshop will discuss ways to increase the efficacy of linguistic resource distribution and programmatic access , and work towards the definition of a new method for these tasks based on distributed processing and object-oriented modelling with deployment on the www . organizers : yorick wilks , hamish cunningham , wim peters , remi zajac workshop scope and aims - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - in general the reuse of of nlp data resources ( such as lexicons or corpora ) has exceeded that of algorithmic resources ( such as lemmatisers or parsers ) . however , there are still two barriers to data resource reuse : 1 ) each resource has its own representation syntax and corresponding programmatic access mode ( e . g . sql for celex , c or prolog for wordnet , sgml for the bnc ) ; 2 ) resources must generally be installed locally to be usable ( and of course precisely how this happens , what operating systems are supported etc . varies from case to case ) . the consequences of 1 ) are that although resources share some structure in common ( lexicons are organised around words , for example ) this commonality is wasted when it comes to using a new resource ( the developer has to learn everything afresh each time ) and that work which seeks to investigate or exploit commonalities between resources ( e . g . to link several lexicons to an ontology ) has to first build a layer of access routines on top of each resources . so , for example , if we wish to do task-based evaluation of lexicons by measuring the relative performance of an information extraction system with different instantiations of lexical resource , we might end up writing code to translate several different resources into sql or sgml . the consequence of 2 ) is that there is no way to "" try before you buy "" : no way to examine a data resource for its suitability for your needs before licencing it . correspondingly there is no way for a resource provider to expose limitted access to their products for advertising purposes , or gain revenue through piecemeal supply of sections of a resource . this workshop will discuss ways to overcome these barriers . the proposers will discuss a new method for distributing and accessing language resources involving the development of a common programmatic model of the various resources types , implemented in corba idl and / or java , along with a distributed server for non-local access . this model is being designed as part of the gate project ( general architecture for text engineering : http : / / www . dcs . shef . ac . uk / research / groups / nlp / gate / ) and goes under the provisional title of an active creole server . ( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources ( e . g . connect wordnet to celex ) , what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . draft program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza louise guthrie roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum paper submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : gill callaghan , fao yorick wilks dept . computer science university of sheffield regent court 211 portobello st . , sheffield s1 4dp uk electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or html . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to ( yorick wilks ) even if they submit in paper form . an electronic submission should be accompanied by a plain ascii text . # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if also submitted electronically ) # note : anything you 'd like to add # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper # . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) february 15th 1998 paper notification april 1st camera - ready papers due may 1st dalr workshop may 27st

around and run a check on the exact same message that was reported, then
it doesn't find the sig and as such isn't spam.

On freshrpms.net, you can find the xmms mp3 plugin as I said, but also

Many other players can also play mp3 files, like alsaplayer, xine, mplayer.> like mplayer not working also and gives black screenThis is not normal though...

0,"Hi all,
I've run into a fairly intractable (for me) problem, and was wondering
if anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it.I am running Debian Woody on a Pentium III IDE based system.
I have a Ricoh 7083a ide cd rewriter, which I use using cdrecord and the
scsi over ide kernel modules.  I was running kernel 2.4.18 until
probably last weekend when I noticed 2.4.19 was out.  Downloaded patch
and installed new kernel with no real problems.  This morning I went to
burn a CDROM, and the system locked hard.  Rebooting into 2.4.18 allowed
cdburning to work fine.This problem is very reproducible (on my system at least).
the cdrecord command I was using was
    cdrecord -v speed=4 blank=fast dev=0,1,0 -data bak.iso
The blanking appears to go ok, but when it tries to write data, it just
locks up the entire system (can't ping it from outside even).  AFAICS,
the system just stops.  Hard reset is only way back in, and when it does
reboot, I cannot see anything useful in any logfiles (/var/log/messages
/var/log/kern.log /var/log/syslog, at any rate).
cdrecord -scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudo-scsi devices (my
cdr drive and my cdrw).
The same lock occurs even if there is no blanking.I tried upgrading to 2.4.20-pre1-ac1 (on assumption that if there was a
kernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches), but it gives
the same error.  I also downloaded and compiled the source for
cdrecord 1.1.10, and installed it instead of the debian package (i was
wondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used
which maybe would cause the problem), and still the problem persisted.Anyway, I'm completely stumped.  Google searching has not done me much
good, and I'm a little bit lost.  What I'd like to know is
a)  How to fix the problem ;-)
b)  Is this likely to be an application or kernel problem?  The severity
    of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem, but I'm
    not very knowledgeable on these things.
c)  Should I post a description of this to the kernel mailing list? If
    this is an appropriate course of action, are there any tips (beyond
    the guidelines on kernel.org)?Like I said, I'm lost on this one, so any info is very gratefully
received.
mick

 it ' s a good software package for mathematical modeling ,
 but there is a limit to the number of different installations any group

 i shall take a look at some new features they offer

 transwestern adds receipt and delivery points
 transwestern pipeline is going through a growth spurt with eight new
 interconnect projects in service or under way , which will add 300 mmcf / d in
 market area deliveries and 285 mmcf / d in new supply receipts . the new or
 expanded connection points will enhance shipper access to both new supplies
 and markets .
 "" there is not a direct relationship between the two [ delivery and receipt
 interconnects ] , "" said jeff fawcett , a transwestern representative . "" it is
 kind of coincidental in nature that they came at the same time , but we have
 ongoing activities to connect new supply and create additional opportunities
 for gas to both be received into transwestern as well as be delivered out of
 transwestern . ""
 included in the delivery interconnect projects , transwestern , an enron unit ,
 recently put 100 mmcf / d into service for new access to markets around las
 vegas with completion of the southwest gas interconnect located in the west
 of thoreau area .
 two other delivery interconnects are expected to be in service during the
 second quarter of 2001 . transwestern will add a 120 mmcf / d delivery
 interconnect with citizens arizona gas for deliveries to the griffith energy
 power plant and a 90 mmcf / d delivery interconnect to a soon to be completed
 calpine plant , both located near kingman in the west of thoreau area .
 on the supply side , transwestern recently has added an 80 mmcf / d receipt
 interconnect in the east of thoreau area with natural gas pipeline co . the
 company also said that it has hooked up a new wellhead supply interconnect
 with enron oil & gas located in the east of thoreau area . the addition will
 bump current supply from 20 mmcf / d to more than 35 mmcf / d .
 transwestern also has three receipt projects scheduled for completion early
 next year . the pipeline said it expects to increase receipt capacity by 100
 mmcf / d at its interconnect with red cedar gathering south of la plata in the
 san juan area later this month , and to put a new 50 mmcf / d receipt
 interconnect with red cedar gathering in service by march 2001 . the company
 also is planning to complete a new 40 mmcf / d receipt interconnect with el
 paso field services in east of thoreau which is scheduled to be in service
 january 2001 .
 transwestern pipeline ' s system consists of approximately 2 , 700 miles of
 natural gas pipeline with combined east - west delivery capability of 1 . 7
 bcf / day . for further information on transportation with transwestern pipeline
 co . , contact fawcett at 713 - 853 - 1521 ."

pickle.  hammie.py, which I just checked in, will optionally let you
write stuff out to a dbm file.  With that same message base, the dbm
file weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB.  It also takes longer to write:  Using a database:
   real    8m24.741s
   user    6m19.410s

be, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says).For comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at
least for speed) on the same data blazes along:   real    0m29.592s
   user    0m28.050s
   sys     0m1.180sIts data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB.
However, it's compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing
algorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we'll never be
able to outperform it.  It's something to keep in mind, though.I don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages.  (Actually, I
do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores
every word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;)  In any
case, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.  On the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking
down to 1.8MB.Neale

It seems that several people are missing the point that this is NOT an image
database.  It is high-resolution topological data rendered in three
dimensions.  Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people
navigate familiar terrain visually.  In other words, it is not intended as a
wannabe spy satellite.  Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model
of the earth's surface.  When a particular region in question is covered in
a city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the
earth's surface.  The part that makes the app killer is that you can map all
sorts of data layers on top of their core topological data.Got it?-James Rogers

0,"Subject: sum : representing retroflex
 
 summary : representing retroflex at the beginning of the month i posted a query that asked for information on an alternative way of representing retroflexed segments as dorsalized coronals instead of [ - anterior ] . warm thanks to those who responded : philip hamilton phamilto @ epas . utoronto . ca richard desrochers desrochr @ ere . umontreal . ca wechsler wechsler @ world . std . com suzanne urbanczyk suzanne @ oitunix . oit . umass . edu mark verhijde mark . verhyde @ let . ruu . nl stig eliasson stig . eliasson @ ling . uu . se here is a list of annotated references followed by contributors ' excerpts on the following topics : 1 . against dorsalization 2 . origins of coronal domination of retroflex : sanskrit evidence 3 . phonetic features of retroflex blevins 1994 . course notes from the 1994 australian linguistic institute . cho , y . 1990 . parameters of consonantal assimilation . phd thesis stanford about sanskrit retroflexed elements . the claim made here is that retroflexation equals the formation of segments that contain two place nodes , cor and dor , i . e . what some have defined as a "" complex "" place . interestingly , in assuming retroflexed segments as having two place nodes , some neutralization effects at right word edges fall out quite naturally . ( verhijde ) dixon no title given . 1980 . languages of australia assumes a feature [ + retroflex ] , as does hamilton 's 1993 toronto paper . eliasson , stig 1986 . sandhi in peninsular scandinavian . in : henning andersen ( ed . ) , sandhi phenomena in the languages of europe , 271-300 . berlin : mouton de gruyter . postalveolarization or retroflexion is a most important sandhi process in swedish and norwegian , and the major part of the above article is devoted to that problem . ( eliasson ) gnanadesikan , amalia no title given . nels 24 1993 . the feature geometry of coronal subplaces . university of massachusetts occasional papers in linguistics 1993 she argues against the feature [ anterior ] for defining coronals . i believe that retroflexes are represented as [ - distributed ] [ + back ] where [ back ] is dorsal . ( urbanczyk ) hamilton , philip 1993 . no title given escol 93 paper on coronal articulation 1993 . no title given toronto working papers in linguistics 1993 . keating , patricia 1991 . coronal places of articulation in the special status of coronals , paradis and prunet , eds . phonetic clues on coronal articulations prince & smolensky 1993 : 179 , citing kirchner 's university of maryland ma thesis . 1 . against dorsalization hamilton : i am currently working on a paper where i argue against dorsalisation more fully , based on a variety of evidence : retroflexes are transparent to + back vowel harmony ; all of the evidence for interaction between retroflexes and back vowels is from very low level phonetic facts ( there are no lexical alternations backing front vowels : / rti / going to [ rtu ] ) and there is never _ neutralisation _ of a lexical back / front contrast conditioned by retroflexes , all that is attested is that front vowels have backed allophones when beside a retroflex ; retroflexes are based represented with a feature dependent on an apical node , since the lack of heteroganic apical clusters may be elegantly expressed with an ocp constraint on adjacent apical nodes . 2 . origins of coronal domination of retroflex : sanskrit wechsler : the presently-orthodox account of retroflection being dominated by the coronal node receives a lot of its support from the sankrit "" rnati "" rule . in this rule , if i recall it correctly , n - > rn anywhere to the right of a retroflex consonant , but intervening non-nasal alveolars block the rule . this kind of interaction between retroflection and the coronal node appears in other places as well ; the one i ' ve studied is in warlpiri , where historically there was a rule that partially unretroflexed a retroflex stop unless it was closely followed by another retroflex . there are other reasons why you might want to avoid involvement with the dorsal tier - - all the vowels live there , and you would have to explain why they are transparent to assimilations involving anteriority . a 3 . phonetic origins desrocher : ladefoged ( 1974 [ 1971 ] : preliminaries . . . ) speaks of retroflexes ( rxs ) as apical postalveolar and gives the example of ewe . he adds : "" in some south asian languages the retroflex consonant involve only the tip of the tongue and the back of the alveolar ridge , whereas in others there is contact between a large part of the underside of the tongue tip and much of the forward part of the hard palate "" and elsewhere , he speaks of the "" extremely retroflex sounds which occur in some indo - aryan languages "" ( hindi , gujerati , penjabi , and so on , i guess ) and when characterizing everything with the spe features , describes rxs as [ - ant , + cor , + high , - back , - low , - dist ] . spe refers to zwicky ( 1965 , his dissert . ) as describing convincingly sanskrit s . as [ - ant ] ( actually , [ - comp ] ) and spe seems to favor the natural class apicals + rxs [ - dist ] as opposed to laminals + non - rxs [ + dist ] . they refer for these matters to ladefoged 1964 a phonetic study of w - afr languages , and maintain that distinction between dentals and rxs support a [ dist ] feature . malmberg ( 1974 , manuel de phonetique generale ) writes that rxs are produced with the tongue markedly curved backwards towards the hard palate , but his diagram , as ladefoged 's , indicates that this the very front of the palate , or the back of the ridge , that is touched by the apex , and mentions south - italians dialects and of course , india . hockett 1958 makes an interesting comment : he says that the same acoustical effect than in the rx in "" bird "" is achieved by some english speakers not by curling back the tip , but by a "" peculiar contour of the central part of the tongue , the tip being held behind the lowe teeth "" . further comments , corrections , and questions welcome - - beau

0,"How many Redhat admins out there use the redhat kickstart?
If you don't use it, how do you install redhat on all your 
workstations, do you do it by hand, with the cds?As we are looking at using Linux at work, I'm looking
into setting up the kickstart. There doesn't seem to
be a lot of documentation around about it.Does anybody know if it would be possible to do the following:
Get the machine to boot using DHCP and read it's kickstart
config file from teh DHCP server and in this config file
have the machine configured to use a static IP, so that when
the machine is rebooted it will come up with it's new IP.Also, There was no driver on the redhat network install flopopy
for the network card in the machine I'm installing. This required
me to uncompress the floppy image, loop mount it, add in the module
for the network card and compress it all up again. I'm not going
to be able to do this every time we get a new machine, I was
wondering if instead of having a boot floppy, you could use a boot
cdrom, but just for the purpose of having all the network card
modules on the cdrom. I'd still want it to get the packages from
an NFS server on the network.Any help with this would be greatly appreciated,
cheers,

              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Compan!
y.Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.

0,"Subject: california update 4 / 9 / 01
 here is what we know so far with the recent announcement of a deal between socal and the state for the transmission lines :
 ? the deal may be enough to save socal from bankruptcy . this will depend on the payment terms as well as how soon socal can receive a positive cash flow .
 ? we are not sure if the state can really do a deal without pg & e or a deal for whole grid . it was thought that a transmission asset deal was not possible without pg the state may still be making the deal contingent upon the purchasing of pg & e ' s assets . a generator source reports that the state is intending to put pressure on the bankruptcy court to close the deal on pg & e ' s lines quickly . however , bankruptcy courts usually do not operate in this manner . in most cases the court would have to hold open proceedings , have competitive bids , etc .
 ? this purchase would need legislative approval , which is not guaranteed . previously the plan was for the state to purchase sce ' s and pg & e ' s assets at a premium so that they would not have to finance power purchases - the utilities would be able to buy power for themselves . now they would have to purchase sce ' s lines , but still finance power purchases because of pg & e . additionally , it is possible that socal swapped the clause allowing then to raise rates in order to recoup past debt in favor for an additional book price . if this any form of a utility bailout - it would probably no gain legislative approval .
 ? the purchase would also need ferc approval . as stated before , if ferc approves such a plan it would be with several conditions for california ."

Is there a relatively clean way to dynamically build comp files based on
the path of the current folder?  Yeah, I know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the
  current folder to the mail root, but that's not what I want.I'm starting to use plus addressing heavily as part of my SPAM controls.
Specifically I each mailing list with a list-specific address.  eg I would subscribe to this list as claw+exmh@kanga.nu or perhaps
  claw+exmh-users@kanga.nu instead of claw@kanga.nuHowever to do this I need a new set of comp files for each list folder.
As I'm subscribed to something just over 600 lists, that's rather a
pain.  I really don't want to go create and maintain ~1,800 comp files
(components, replcomps, replgroupcomps), especially not as I suspect
I'll be changing or adapting my naming pattern a few times as I adapt
various supporting tools.What would be great is if I could build the relevant comp file
dynamically at runtime.  That way I don't need to maintain a couple
thousand comp files, I just need to make my plus addresses
predictable/computable based (say) on the folder path.  eg I'm currently in folder:    +-Lists-/Products/Exmh-L    The script would dynamically build a compfile which had a From: of
    claw+exmh@kanga.nu for repl, comp, etc.  Similarly when in folder:    +-Lists-/Linux/SVLUG-L  I'd get a From: of claw+svlug@kanga.nuThat way I can use lookup tables for those folders which have multiple
lists being delivered into them.Any ideas how this might be done in an automatic/maintainable fashion?
It would be more than good enough if all I had to do was drop a tiny
FROM_HEADER file in each folder that somehow got picked up by the comp
file...--

 i want you to stand as his next of kin .
 i am barrister esse edewor , a solicitor . i am the personal
 attorney to engr . fredrick pickard , who used to work with
 panalpina shipping company of nigeria . on the 2 nd of april
 2000 , my client , his wife and their three children were
 involved in a car accident . all occupants of the vehicle
 unfortunately lost thier lives .
 since then i have made several enquiries to locate any of
 my clients extended relatives , this has also proved
 unsuccessful . after these several unsuccessful attempts , i
 decided to trace his relatives over the internet , to locate
 any member of his family but to no avail , hence i contacted
 you .
 i have contacted you to assist in repartrating the money
 and property left behind by my client before they get
 confisicated or declared unserviceable by the bank where
 this huge deposits were lodged . particularly , the bank where
 the deceased had an account valued at about $ 12 . 5 million
 dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin
 or have the account confisicated within the next ten
 official working days .
 since i have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives
 for over 2 years now i seek your consent to present you as
 the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of
 this account valued at $ 12 . 5 million dollars can be paid to
 you as his next of kin and then you and me can share the
 money . 65 % to me and 30 % to you , while 5 % should be for
 expenses or tax as your government may require .
 i have all necessary legal documents that can be used to
 back up any claim we may make . all i require is your honest
 cooperation to enable us see this deal through . i guarantee
 that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
 that will protect you from any breach of the law . please if
 you have accepted in transacting this deal with me get in
 touch with me through my telephone number - - 234 805 - 6271540
 and as well email me through my alternative email address
 which is : esseedewor @ omnimail . sm indicating your interest
 and also to discuss further so as tell you the necessary
 proceedings to follow to get this fund transfered to your
 bank account . it is 100 % risk free .

0,"BlogStart: **Dublin**: something from the archives.    Daev Walsh forwards an article from
The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''.  This story is also immortalised
in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy
was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I
now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely
legal, way to make money.BlogEnd: 
LinkText: Billy in the BowlFrom:         daev 
Subject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerA story of my new neighbourhood...
The Irish Digest July 1964
The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.
Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the
architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of
beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these
beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one
who campaigned among the working class.  This was ""Billy In The Bowl""The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means
of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this ""
bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground
with wooden plugs, one in each hand.Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been
born without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing
him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an
unusually handsome face.This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating
sympathetic passers-by from their small change.The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many
lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century
Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would
come along.He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his
black curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a
handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily
owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were
substantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could
indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.
The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening
as dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing
through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on
Dublin's North Quays.When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a
ditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the
beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay
concealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two
powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.In a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy
was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's
purse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was
found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her
assailant.  And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a
deformed beggar.Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting
the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy
servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to
strangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder
and caused a great stir.Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months
""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this
period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first
case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.Months passed and  ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old
pasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and
robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a
nightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled
along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that
finished Billy's career of crime.Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment
after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to
hear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the
ditch.Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and
tried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,
however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her
large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the
district and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member
of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but
they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The
Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive
Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed
and giggled as they wended their way home at night.daev_______________________________

SUMMARYAs part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a ""public"" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.GATHERING THE DATAWhile traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their ""brightness"" - varies according to temperature.Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTSA recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a ""remarkable"" level of agreement between the two.To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by ""radiosonde"" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054Â° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.""The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" Christy said. ""If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.""The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28Â° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23Â° Fahrenheit) per decade.Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.""These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" Christy said. ""They are not representative of the total globe.""Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05Â° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.GLOBAL COVERAGEOne advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""Radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSUWith nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERSOf great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITYWhile the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.THE SCIENTISTSIn 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.""AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.DR. JOHN CHRISTYChristy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987, after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno, his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, and his M.S. (1984) and Ph.D. (1987) degrees in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois.He was an instructor of mathematics at Parkland College in Champaign, IL, 1983-87, an instructor of mathematics at the University of South Dakota, 1981-82, and an instructor of mathematical sciences at Yankton (S.D.) College, 1980-81.He also served as pastor of the Grace Baptist Church in Vermillion, S.D., 1978-82, and as science master at Baptist High School, Nyeri, Kenya, 1973-75. He has published more than 20 refereed scientific papers.Christy serves on the NOAA National Scientific Review Panel for the National Climatic Data Center, and on NOAA's Pathfinder Review Panel. He was an ""invited key contributor"" to the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's scientific assessment of climate change, and served as a contributor to the 1992 and 1994 IPCC reports.DR. ROY SPENCERSpencer began his career as a research associate at the Space Science and Engineering Center in Madison, WI, in 1981, after earning his B.S. (1978) in meteorology at the University of Michigan and his M.S. (1979) and Ph.D. (1981) degrees in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was a Universities Space Research Association visiting scientist at MSFC, 1984-87, before joining the MSFC staff in 1987.He is the U.S. team leader for the Multichannel Microwave Imaging Radiometer Team and has served on numerous committees relating to remote sensing. He directs a program involving satellite and aircraft passive microwave data to build global climate data sets and to address climate research issues. Spencer is lead author on sixteen scientific papers.BIBLIOGRAPHY(1) J.R. Christy, 1995, ""Climatic Change,"" Vol. 31, pp. 455-474.(2) J.R. Christy, R.W. Spencer and R.T.

Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers volunteering a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. 
Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to 
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a 
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for organizations that might be in need of such skills. And, I've 
seen some very interesting suggestions for names for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the 
above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the 
subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort 
through my email system.It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. 
According to this article on The Register, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
upgrade at $129.I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how 
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, 
by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 
2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which 
were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few 
years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain 
free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income sources.On a brighter note, it looks like Mandrake has found a sweet spot. According to their most 
recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the 
company's
history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
the result of the Mandrake Linux User's
Club.The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with Microtel to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on WalMart.com.
I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the 
addition of both Lindows 
and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail 
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.Have a great Wednesday.

procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong 
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE 
desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't 
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much 
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the 
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an 
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple 
configuration issue.To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute 
window, change the command line to read:Â Â Â Â kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %mThe addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when 
you open the program.Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?

Kernel Configuration - Part XIIIAs you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for 
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to 
stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel 
configuration is dense with details and options.I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of 
the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock 
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. 
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be 
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:
The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo
Â Â covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel 
configuration issues
Linux Network Security from Linux Planet
Â Â a nice tutorial on network security
Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4
Â Â other approaches to network security
These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your 
Linux kernel.

Linux PR
http://linuxpr.com/If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for 
a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in 
the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in 
descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real 
downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very 
company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases. 
Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on

some expert interpretation of these results?It looks like the old record for, say, 199 bits, has been
blown out of the water by a factor of ~100,000.Does this mean that Eliptic Curve encryption is
now easily breakable? Or faster than before with
no loss in strength? Or stronger?Raw bits are OK, cooked bits are better.- Gordon

 we can re - imburse you for shipping expenses up to a reasonable amount , say
 $ 500 , if you need to ship things down . you can just save the receipts for
 these expenses and shirley can fill out the necessary expense forms .

 2nd call for papers the first workshop on embodied conversational characters granlibakken resort & conference center at lake tahoe tahoe city ( north shore ) california , usa october 12-15 , 1998 with the support of aaai cooperation of acm / sigchi recent advances in several core software technologies have made possible a new type of human-computer interface : the conversational character . conversational characters are autonomous , anthropomorphic , animated figures that have the ability to communicate through multiple modalities , including spoken language , facial expressions , and gestures . unlike textual natural language interfaces , conversational characters have the ability to perceive and produce the verbal and non-verbal signals that identify discourse structure and regulate the flow of information between interlocutors . such signals include intonational patterns , gestures , back-channel feedback signals , and turn-taking protocols . these capabilities enable them to engage in complex interactions with human users via natural speech rather than complex command languages , menus or graphical manipulations . research on conversational characters has emerged from a number of disciplines , including , among others , artificial intelligence , computational linguistics , computer animation , computer vision , psychology , cognitive science , virtual reality , cscw , and hci . this diversity is naturally reflected in the broad range of active research areas in conversational character interfaces . the primary goal of this workshop is to advance the state of conversational character research and development by identifying novel approaches to the topics and issues listed below , and integrating them into a framework for embodied , conversational human-computer interaction . selected contributors will be invited to expand and refine their papers for inclusion in a book to be published by addison - wesley . the aims of this book will be to introduce , define , and advance the field ; to give a snapshot of current work in it ; and to suggest future challenges and opportunities . particular topics of interest include , but are not limited to : * multi - modal interaction * autonomy * recognition & perception of speech , * behavior / dialogue planning gesture , facial expressions , etc . * distribution of semantic information * reactivity and opportunism across multiple modalities * rendering techniques * representation * semantic representations for * character individuation non-verbal communication * dialogue planning * affect and personality * turn - taking and back-channel signals * user studies * spoken language processing * tools for character * discourse structure building / authoring * intonation * architectures & applications papers should address one or more of these topics . demonstrations and video presentations of working systems are strongly encouraged . format the two and a half-day workshop will include several paper sessions , organized around emerging themes , with follow-up panel discussions . in addition , there will be a demonstration session for authors to present working systems . attendance attendance will be limited to 35-40 people . preference will be given to authors whose papers have been selected for presentation at the workshop . submission requirements paper submissions are due on june 15 , 1998 , and should be no longer than 6 pages ( 10-12 point font ) . upon acceptance , authors will be given the opportunity to expand their papers to 8-10 pages . electronic submissions in postscript or microsoft word formats are preferred , and should be sent to prevost @ pal . xerox . com . otherwise , send four hardcopies to : scott prevost attn : embodied conversational characters workshop fx palo alto laboratory 3400 hillview avenue , bldg . 4 palo alto , ca 94304 voice : 650 / 813-7701 deadlines submissions due june 15th notification of acceptance august 17th final papers due september 14th workshop october 12th - 15th workshop organizers joseph w . sullivan , fx palo alto lab , usa ( sullivan @ pal . xerox . com ) justine cassell , mit media laboratory , usa ( justine @ media . mit . edu ) workshop program committee committee co - chairs : scott prevost , fx palo alto lab , usa ( prevost @ pal . xerox . com ) elizabeth churchill , fx palo alto lab , usa ( churchill @ pal . xerox . com ) committee members : elisabeth andr , dfki gmbh , germany ( elisabeth . andre @ dfki . de ) gene ball , microsoft research , usa ( geneb @ microsoft . com ) phil cohen , oregon graduate institute , usa ( pcohen @ cse . ogi . edu ) barbara hayes - roth , stanford univ . , usa ( hayes-roth @ cs . stanford . edu ) kenji mase , atr international , japan ( mase @ mic . atr . co . jp ) clifford nass , stanford university , usa ( nass @ leland . stanford . edu ) mark steedman , university of pennsylvania , usa ( steedman @ cis . upenn . edu ) kris thorisson , lego a / s , denmark ( kris @ digi . lego . com ) demos chair : timothy bickmore , isii inc . , usa ( bickmore @ pal . xerox . com ) additional information for more information , please consult the workshop web page : www . fxpal . com / wecc98 /

1,"Subject: urgent assistance .
 from : ms sarah guei
 cocody , abidjan
 cote d i ' voire
 this mail may be a surprise to you because you did not give me the permission to do so and neither do you know me but before i tell you about myself i want you to please forgive me for sending the mail without your permission . it is because i need your assistance and please mail me on my private box as stated below .
 my name is sarah adidi guei , the daughter of the late military ruler of ivory - coast ( retired brigadier general robert guei ) who was assasinated in a political crisis which led to war in my country ( ivory - coast ) on 19 th september , 2002 . my father , mother and two junior brothers were killed by some soldiers believed to be loyal to the government because of my father ' s objection to some certain policies of the present government . i was lucky to have escaped with a brother who is the last child of the family that night because we were visiting a family friend in another city far away from our home .
 i have to go into hiding with my junior brother for some days before arrangements were made for us to leave ivory - coast for the republic of togo on the invitation of president eyadema of togo who granted us political assylum .
 before we left for togo , i visited our home where my mother and my two junior ones were killed in our village and during the search for some documents in my father ' s room came accross some vital documents and the keys to a secret vault in the house . i took the keys and went down to where the vault is and there i discovered two metal boxes which were carefully hidden . with the aide of the documents i was able to open the boxes only to find out that the boxes were full of money in hundred dollar bills . i could not count the money because i was very shock to see it and again it is too much for me to count but the documents that i discovered in his room which led me to the boxes put the money at $ 10 , 000 , 000 ( ten million usd ) .
 i locked it back carefully and arranged for the boxes to be moved with me through the help of some family friends to abidjan the capital city where i deposited it with a security company for safe - keeping . i did not declare the content of boxes to the security company , i only declare it as family valuables .
 when the african leaders came to ivory - coast and president eyadema invited us to go to the republic of togo where i now live with my junior one .
 i cannot touch the money and even afraid to tell it to our family friends who have been coming to visit us in togo . i decided that it will be better to move the money abroad where i can put to safe and have it invested . this has been my reason for contacting you .
 i would have given you my telephone number so that you can call me in order to discuss the issue better but i ' m afraid to do so because we have too many people around us who i would not want to know of the money . it will be better for me to communicate through internet until we can make proper and solid arrangements about how to move the money .
 i wish to meet with you if you can make a trip to the republic of togo or ivory - coast , then we can meet secretly before we go ahead for the transaction . i am ready to offer 20 % of the money to you for this assistance . it is not that i am paying you but for your assistance which i shall really appreciate .
 please i wish that this assistance be treated highly confidential .
 waiting to read your response about the proposal soonext .

0,"Subject: discount rates and risk capital
 dear vince :
 i spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on
 determining discount rates than i originally anticipated . it is somewhat
 surprising , but there really isn ' t much academic work that i am aware of
 that addresses these issues .
 very briefly ,
 1 . i think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk
 capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate .
 2 . i think it is important to model enron ' s opportunity cost of capital and
 how that changes over time . the liquidity of a project will affect its
 value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital
 changes over time . there is also likely to be a relation between duration
 and discount rates that depends on the factors generating enron ' s
 opportunity cost of capital .
 3 . i have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify
 some of the issues that i have raised .
 please take a look at the attached document . you might find this somewhat
 confusing , so i will give you a call later in the week to discuss this .
 please let me know when you will be free . i look forward to hearing from you .
 regards ,

 casali , roderic f . ; resolving hiatus ; 0-8153 - 3149 - 5 , cloth ; pages , $ 59 ; garland publishing ; outstanding dissertations in linguistics this study investigates two alternative ways in which languages resolve sequences of adjacent vowels ( hiatus ) : deletion of one of the vowels , or coalescence of the adjacent vowels to form a third vowel that combines features of both the originals . although existing phonological theories predict relatively few restrictions on the behavior of either process , a survey of 92 languages reveals a number of surprising and previously unreported limitations on their behavior . for example , although deletion of the first of two vowels is extremely common and can apply in any position , deletion of the second vowel is restricted to certain well-defined morpho-syntactic contexts , such as the boundary between a root and a suffix . these restrictions , are explained in terms of functionally-motivated constraints that favor preservation of phonological material in certain prominent positions , such as in root morphemes . in the case of coalescence , the study reveals a surprising correlation between the structure of a language 's vowel inventory and the result of merging high and a non-high vowels . this correlation is explained in terms of a novel theory of acoustic height features whose detailed specification is determined by functionally-motivated constraints sensitive to the number of vowel heights within a particular language . e - mail : info @ garland . com

 dear colleagues : i have a number of questions regarding laryngeal phonetics . 1 . i understand that english voiced stops are phonetically voiceless unaspirated in initial position . ( data are cited in kingston & diehl 1994 : 432-434 . [ kingston , john , and randy l . diehl , 1994 , phonetic knowledge , _ language _ 70 : 3 . 419-454 . ] ) what is the story about pretonic intervocalic allophones after unstressed , short vowels , e . g . fidelity , legality , mobility ? to my ear they sound the same as in delegate , gallon , billion , but to my english - prejudiced ear they also sound voiced . 2 . what is the story about laryngealization or creaky voice ? i have seen this described as "" a very slow vibration through only one end of the vocal cords "" ( crystal , _ dictionary of linguistics _ ( ? inexact citation ) ) . what are the arytenoid cartilages doing at the posterior end of the vocal folds ? how is it related to the closure for glottal stop and for glottalized consonants ? 3 . what is going on with the articulation of "" stage whispered "" speech ? in whisper , the arytenoids are rotated so as to adduct the posterior ends of the vocal folds at their anterior ends , but the posterior ends of the arytenoids are not themselves adducted by the interarytenoid muscles , leaving a restricted , triangular opening at which sibilant-like turbulence is generated in place of voice . introspecting , stage whisper seems to me to be like whisper only with some turbulence as air passes the closure of the main ( anterior ) portion of the vocal folds . there seems to be somewhat higher subglottal air pressure , like a "" shouted "" whisper , but it does not seem to be merely a question of forcing air past the closed vocal folds . there seem to be some additional differences of articulation to produce the turbulence over the vocal folds , as evidenced at least by increased tension in observable laryngeal and ( to some extent ) pharyngeal muscles . it also seems to me that some degree of pharyngealization is an incidental byproduct . 4 . how is this related to pharyngeal spirants , as exemplified by arabic ? 5 . kingston and diehl ( 1994 : 441 ) say that "" in languages such as english "" ( meaning , i take it , languages without contrastive voiced aspirates ) the phonological distinction [ + / - voice ] is signaled in part by aspiration initially , but not ( if i read them right ) intervocalically . more important , it is said , is the ratio of duration of consonants to duration of vowels , or perhaps the duration of v to vc syllable rimes ( ? ) . can someone say more about this ? these questions bear on characteristics of a language i am working on . in the near term for purposes of defining the issues and refining research strategy , specific information will be more helpful to me than pointers to the literature , because my access to research library resources is not easy ( actually , it 's rather difficult ) , but i will need the pointers too and must of course eventually follow them up . all help will be greatly appreciated . please respond to me and not to the list . if there is interest i will post a summary . bruce nevin bn @ lightstream . com

 louise ,
 here are some bullet points for the discussions tomorrow :
 - east power , including generation investments made about $ 50 million in the first half . the greatest contribution came from ben jacoby , about $ 15 million . by the way , i hired ben along with scott healy to acquire sites in 1998 .
 - all of the traders and structuring , including bernie aucoin told me that john llodra drove both the cmp and nstar deals . total income $ 8 . 5 million .
 - i believe delainey was correct in saying that ozzie was the brains behind alamac but heather did the execution . total income for the east $ 7 . 5 million .
 - most of the rest of the deals were done after i came in .
 - mid market sales have increased . ( 700 % over the first half of 2000 )
 - this group was in meltdown when i came in ( at least on the origination side ) . i would like to get some credit for stopping the bleeding and starting the rebuilding process in a difficult environment ."

 oil for america has been successful in locating the reefs
 33 out of 33 times !
 delek ' s main project involves exploring for the mississippian aged lodgepole carbonate build - ups in the williston basin of montana and north dakota , as well as the hardeman basin in west texas . a new exploration technique is being applied to this play , which has proven succesfull . the lodgepole limestone was deposited in a very shallow ancestral williston basin . the carbonate formation was developed as thousands of small , circular limestone build - ups , or reefs . the average distribution of the build - ups is about 4 reefs per square - mile section . the lodgepole reefs were deposited within a fairway a thousand miles long and thirty miles wide on the shelf of the williston basin . the reservoirs in the williston basin may produce as much as 2 , 000 barrels per day ( bopd ) at depths of 7 , 500 to 9 , 500 feet . the most prolific reefs have each produced as much as 4 , 000 , 000 barrels of light , sweet oil .
 the lodgepole reefs are visible in surface outcrop in the far western part of the williston basin . this allows the sense of scale and geometry of the reefs can be observed first hand . delek resource ' s technology partner in this play is a company named oil for america ( ofa ) . ofa has applied a proprietary photo - analytical program known as all remote sensing analysis . this analysis detects the location of waulsortian reef cores . this program produces well - defined images that correlate with the oil producing wells .
 oil for america ' s first partner , conoco who was the major player in the lodgepole reef play , stated that the lodgepole reefs are the most economic production it has anywhere in the world . the average well in the united states produces a few barrels per day . each one of these lodgepole wells is so prolific that it amounts to a thousand of those wells .
 because each well may produce 2000 bod and 4 , 000 , 000 bo cumulatively from a single well - bore , well in excess $ 100 , 000 , 000 of revenue may be generated from a well in a relatively brief period of production .
 the potential for significant new discoveries in the williston basin began in february 1993 . from a wildcat well near dickinson , north dakota , conoco tested a heretofore non - productive interval in the lodgepole limestone . the carbonate zone had good porosity and gas shows , so after failing to find pay in their deeper objectives , a production test was reluctantly taken at 9 , 721 - 9 , 850 feet . the discovery well , dickinson lodgepole unit # 74 , initially produced at a rate of 419 bopd . the well has produced nearly 2 million barrels of 41 . 4 api gravity sweet crude oil and 1 . 2 bcf of natural gas to date . this discovery ignited a frantic race between 1993 and 1997 where major and independent oil companies attempted to develop and expand the lodgepole find using conventional 2 - d and 3 d seismic programs . the best wells flowed up to an allowable rate of 2 , 000 bopd . the conoco dickinson lodgepole # 75 is the single most productive well , having produced 4 , 000 , 000 barrels of oil and nearly 2 bcf of gas since september 1993 . this well still produces thousands of barrels a month after more than nine years of production . during this time , the lodgepole reef play became the largest onshore play in america .
 this success , however , was not without failure . the ability to seismically delineate discrete reefs has been very difficult and misleading . the geophysical characteristics of the lodgepole limestone are nearly identical with the overlying carbonate beds . this creates very poor acoustic contrast between the formations , so seismic differentiation between the formations is difficult . as a result , by 1996 the search for additional lodgepole reefs had stalled .
 the play was recently revitalized when continental resources made another accidental discovery in december 2000 in valley county , montana , 155 miles northwest of dickinson , north dakota . in this area the lodgepole reefs are shallower at 7 , 200 feet . this reef initially produced at 2 , 000 barrels per day , but has now begun producing water . it appears that the well was drilled on the flank of a reef , close to water . the discovery dramatically increases the exploratory opportunities for future discoveries in the lodgepole .
 oil for america has been successful in locating the reefs 33 out of 33 times ! , and has now begun using another technology to differentiate reefs that show signs of hydrocarbons , as to minimize the possibility of drilling a reef that would be a dry hole , and is confident that the three technologies applied overall makes the chances of drilling a successful producing reef excellent . using these technologies delek will drill those targets in the williston basin .
 delek intends to raise money , and acquire producing properties in the near term . the properties would complement the exploration as it will be in the same areas as the exploration the company is pursuing .

) : katherine ) woolard . she mentioned that in the california "" official ) english "" push not only were many hispanics in favor of the ) proposed legislation , but so were many supposed liberals in ) the san francisco area . she was doing an analysis of ) discourse in which such liberals justified their positions , ) showing that they were based on hidden assumptions that ) actually ran counter to their claimed liberal beliefs . all this ) points up the fact that oppressed people , with the help of ) their well-meaning supporters , often participate in their own ) oppression . indeed , historical examples indicate that such is ) true even to the point that oppressed groups help organize ) extermination of their own members for oppressing groups . ) so , the results of the polls you cite are not so transparently ) meaningful . a respondent or two drew conclusions from the oft-mentioned hysterical tone of the fundraising materials put out by the "" official english "" movement . my own thoughts on that , as sent to one respondent : on tue , 13 jun 1995 jpkirchner @ aol . com wrote : ) i ' m convinced there is a certain style to fundraising letters ) that crosses the political spectrum , especially since a lot of ) organizations certainly have their letters written by direct ) marketing agencies that are probably not affiliated with any ) particular persuasion . i get such letters from political ) campaigns on the left , right , and in between , including the ) democratic party , and i see absolutely the same nauseatingly > hysterical , hateful style in all of them , as if they were ) written by the same hand . ( which they sometimes may ) have been . ) in one letter , the boogie man is "" liberals who ) want to take away your freedom , "" in another it 's "" advocates ) for the rich who want to make you homeless , "" in another it 's ) immigrants , in a third it 's jingoists . the common ) denominator is always the angry , hateful tone they ' re ) written in . having worked at an ad agency , i know that the ) people in them know their targets , and just how to caress ) them or zing their fillings to get them to act . it has to be an ) established fundraising technique . this whole issue seems to me to be a mix of radical hysteria on both sides , mixed with legitimate questions , which neither side appears willing to address . since linguists , to my experience , are generally terrific at preaching linguistic tolerance , but do n't often deal with pragmatic questions that do n't affect them personally , i ' ll annoy you all with a few questions brought up by non-linguists i know . these people are neither radical conservatives , nor bothered by the use of other languages or dialects in their presence . 1 . how come in us regions where other foreign language groups outnumber hispanics , are safety warnings and federal signage are still only posted in spanish and english ? 2 . a manager , who had previously not minded foreign languages being spoken in the office , is suddenly noticing a lot of discord , backbiting and insubordination among the employees . these are hard enough to quell when everyone is speaking english , but it 's even harder for this manager to monitor what 's happening , because it 's all going on in a foreign language . does the manager a . ) sign up for a beginning language course , b . ) quit the job and give it to someone fluent in the other language , c . ) recruit some of the employees as "" spies "" , d . ) mandate english , e . ) other _ _ _ _ _ ? if the manager mandates english , will it qualify as linguistic intolerance in this case ? 3 . why should a child who speaks black american english be accommodated in the classroom by court order , while an appalachian kid gets forced to learn ( later changed to "" gets the benefit of learning "" ) the standard dialect ( i . e . , in addition to his or her own ) ? 4 . "" the typists in our company are so incompetent at standard english that even a simple business letter takes them at five drafts , and one whole day , to get into acceptable form . it always comes out in their dialect , and it 's much easier for everybody to do their own typing . why can't they give these people english tests ? "" these are linguistic and political questions to these people , to which i have no ready answers . what do other linguists say ? james kirchner

 announces that
 the sylvan lake oil and gas project is still awaiting a rig at this time .
 the surface

 available for
 over two weeks , and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest .
 the company has a 25 % working interest in the sylvan lake project .

 the value of mogi ' s shares will skyrocket :
 1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull
 market in a generation .
 2 . natural gas prices have tripled in the last two years .
 3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
 reserves worth multi - millions , mogi is selling for less than 1 / 4 the
 value of its assets .
 4 . montana oil and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
 unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises .
 already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the
 overall market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
 sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized
 explorers and developers like montana oil ( mogi ) that the biggest gains
 are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made triple
 and even quadruple returns .

 oil at all - time highs and with the popularity of drilling in alberta ,

 the demand for rig and crew is at an all - time high as well ; all we can do is
 be patient until a rig is secured . all permits are in place and shareholders
 will be updated once drilling begins . ' '
 montana oil and gas will participate in a minimum 4 - well program , on a third

 a quarter basis , called sylvan lake , located west of red deer , alberta .
 montana oil and gas '
 cost per well is $ 180 , 000 , with the first well to be drilled upon rig

 it is a 7 , 200 - foot peskisko sand test that is prospective for oil and in
 upper pay zone ` ` shunda ' ' for gas .
 each development well has probable production of a minimum 150 barrels of
 oil per day
 and 750 , 000 cubic feet gas per day with potential reserves in excess of 1
 billion cubic feet gas
 and 300 , 000 barrels oil . there are five prospective pay zones , the average
 well in the sylvan lake field
 has produced 500 barrels oil per day with over one million cubic feet gas
 per day

 * * * call for participation * * * seventh message understanding system evaluation and message understanding conference ( muc - 7 ) evaluation : 2 - 6 march 1998 conference : april 1998 washington , d . c . area sponsored by : the human language systems tipster text program of the defense advanced research projects agency information technology office ( darpa / ito ) the message understanding conferences have provided on ongoing forum for assessing the state of the art and practice in text analysis technology and for exchanging information on innovative computational techniques in the context of fully implemented systems that perform realistic tasks . the evaluations have provided researchers and potential sponsors and customers with a quantitative means to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the technologies , and the results reported on at the conferences have sparked customer interest in the potential utility of the technologies . the seventh message understanding conference ( muc - 7 ) will provide an opportunity for both new and experienced muc participants to participate in a flexible evaluation , suited to development needs and abilities . it will provide : * opportunity to select among a variety of tasks : named entity ( ne ) , coreference ( co ) , template element ( te ) , template relationship ( tr ) and scenario template ( st ) . * two tasks for evaluating component technologies ( ne and co ) , which use standard generalized markup language ( sgml ) as output format * redesigned information extraction ( ie ) task , with two domain-independent subtasks ( te and tr ) separated from domain-dependent subtask ( st ) . * emphases of st task on portability and on minimizing human resources required to participate in the evaluation . * three experimental tracks to explore new data sets and tasks . participation in muc - 7 is actively sought from both new and veteran organizations . with the new and redesigned evaluation tasks , muc - 7 offers a good opportunity for organizations to try out new ideas for handling nlp problems that are of both scientific and practical interest without having to participate in the entire range of tasks . the conference itself will consist primarily of presentations and discussions of innovative techniques , system design , and test results . there will also be an opportunity for participants to demo their evaluation systems . attendance at the conference is limited to evaluation participants and to guests invited by the darpa tipster text program . a conference proceedings , including test results , will be published . schedule : 1 july 97 : application deadline for participation 15 july 97 : release of ne , co , te , tr , and example st training data and scorer 8 september 97 : release of dry run st task definition , training data , and scorer 29 sept - 3 oct 97 : muc - 7 dry run ( all participants ) 6 february 98 : release of formal test st task definition , training data , and scorer 2 - 6 march 98 : muc - 7 formal run 7 - 9 april 98 : 7th message understanding conference ( tentative dates ) data and task description : the texts to be used for system development and testing are news service articles from the new york times news service , supplied by the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) [ ldc @ ldc . upenn . edu ] . training , dry run , and test data for all the tasks are extracted from a corpus of approximately 158 , 000 articles . sets of articles to be used in the muc - 7 evaluation will be distributed via ftp upon payment of a one time fee of $ 100 and upon signing of a user agreement for the use of these texts . the user agreement can be retrieved from the ldc catalog ( evaluation agreements ) . the url for the ldc home page is : http : / / www . ldc . upenn . edu . five separate evaluations will be conducted as part of muc - 7 . the definition of these evaluations has been worked out since late 1996 by members of the muc - 7 planning committee . the evaluations may be viewed as capturing the results of text analysis at various levels of aggregation of information : * named entity ( ne ) requires only that the system under evaluation identify each bit of pertinent information in isolation from all others . * coreference ( co ) requires connecting all references to "" identical "" entities . * template element ( te ) requires grouping entity attributes together into entity "" objects . "" * template relationship ( tr ) requires identifying relationships between template elements . * scenario template ( st ) requires identifying instances of a task-specific event and identifying event attributes , including entities that fill some role in the event ; the overall information content is captured via interlinked "" objects . "" * experimental tracks using new data sets are variants of the ne task . the task definition is the same as for the basic ne task , but the texts are different . * experimental track involving a new task is a simplified version of the te task . key things to note about each evaluation task : * ne covers named organizations , people , and locations , along with date / time expressions and monetary and percentage expressions ; it requires production of sgml tags as output . * co covers noun phrases ( common and proper ) and personal pronouns that are "" identical "" in their reference ; it requires production of sgml tags as output ; the tags for coreferring strings form "" equivalance "" classes , which are used for scoring . * te covers organizations , persons , and artifacts , which are captured in the form of template "" objects "" consisting of a predefined set of attributes . * tr covers relationships among template elements , including location and time relationships , which are captured in the form of template "" relations "" consisting of a relationship and the template elements participating in that relationship . tr is a new task for muc - 7 . * st covers a particular scenario , which is kept secret until one month prior to testing in order to focus on system portability ; however , the generalized structure of a scenario template is predefined , and example scenarios are available for participants to examine . this task is domain dependent . * tasks for the experimental tracks are derived from ne and te . there is a world wide web site that allows automated testing following the rules of muc - 6 . it will be of particular value to new participants . the website is password protected and you need to be licensed to access the acl / dci disk from the ldc to obtain a password from chinchor @ gso . saic . com . muc - 6 articles were taken from the acl / dci disk . an anonymous ftp site will be available for downloading muc - 7 related material . this cfp and the muc - 7 participant agreement are available to the public from the ftp site . each participant ( after signing the ldc user agreement and a muc - 7 participation agreement ) will receive a password to download the muc - 7 data , definitions , and scoring software at the release times noted above . the url of the website is http : / / muc . saic . com . the ftp site is ftp . muc . saic . com . test protocol and evaluation criteria : muc - 7 participants may elect to do one or any combination of tasks and experimental tracks . participants will have access to shared resources such as the training texts and annotations / templates , task documentation , and scoring software . all muc - 7 participants are encouraged to participate in the dry run and take advantage of material available . the formal test will be conducted during the first week in march . it will be carried out by the participants at their own sites in accordance with a prepared test procedure and the results submitted to the ftp site for official scoring with the software prepared by saic for muc - 7 . test sets used for the evaluations will consist of 100 texts , with subsets for some of the tasks . there will be different data sets for the dry run and the formal test . systems will be evaluated using recall and precision metrics ( all tasks ) , f - measure ( all tasks ) , and error-based metrics ( all tasks except co ) . the computation of these metrics is based on the scoring categories of correct , partial , incorrect , spurious , missing , and noncommittal . muc - 7 participants will be able to familiarize themselves with the evaluation criteria through usage of the evaluation software , which will be released along with the training data . instructions for responding to the call for participation : organizations within and outside the u . s . are invited to respond to this call for participation . by the time of the actual testing phase of the evaluation , systems must be able to accept texts without manual preprocessing , process them without human intervention , and output annotations ( ne , co ) or templates ( te , tr , st ) in the expected format . organizations should plan on allocating approximately two person-months of effort for participation in the evaluation and conference . it is understood that organizations will vary with respect to experience with sgml text annotation , information extraction , domain expertise / engineering , resources , contractual demands / expectations , etc . recognition of such factors will be made in any analyses of the results . organizations wishing to participate in the evaluation and conference must respond by july 1 , 1997 by submitting a short statement of interest via email and a signed copy of the muc -

0,"Subject: language resources & evaluation workshop
 
 workshop announcement and call for papers linguistic coreference workshop 26 may 1998 , morning session held in conjunction with the first international conference on language resources and evaluation granada , spain ( 28-30 may 1998 ) workshop aims it is essential , for a natural language processing system , to instantiate each object , process , attribute , and property correctly , so that all references to the same item be recognized as such and an inventory of all distinct items be accurate at all times . this problem is far from being resolved . there are both linguistic and computational reasons for this deficiency . first , there is no satisfactory microtheory of linguistic coreference . secondly and consequently , there is no satisfactory application of such a microtheory to nlp . a microtheory of coreference in natural language includes in its scope all the phenomena that satisfy the following condition : an object / entity , an event , an attribute , a property or its value , an attitude , or any combination of the above is referred to more than once in a natural-language text , and the understanding of the text depends on the correct interpretation of the two or more referring expressions as designating the same object , event , etc . a linguistic microtheory of coreference for a language consists of the following elements : - a complete range of covered phenomena in the language ; - a taxonomy of the range ; - a typology of the range ; - a list of rules forming the various types of coreference ; - a list of rules interpreting the various types of coreference . there has been a considerable amount of work on a few selected types of coreference , focusing almost exclusively on object coreference . thus , significant work has been done in theoretical linguistics on anaphora and cataphora , subsuming , for the large part , earlier work on deixis . a small minority of authors have tried to extend their studies of anaphora beyond mere syntax . in the cognitive-linguistics and philosophy-of - language traditions , interesting work has been done relating anaphora and deixis to ambiguity resolution and discourse structure . at the same time , an effort in comparative-contrastive linguistics has led some writers to examining the data of more than one language at a time , still emphasizing entity or object reference . in computational linguistics , the problem of coreference took early on the form of pronoun antecedent resolution , and this particular task , somewhat broadened to include a few other types of anaphora , still remains in the center of the problem . the most sustained effort in the computational treatment of coreference has been mounted within the tipster / muc - 6 initiative . while it has been recognized since quite early in the game that coreference resolution is based in large part on world knowledge , most of the work done on the matter computationally and theoretically ignores and avoids world knowledge . the muc - 6 initiative makes such an orientation quite explicit : the work should be based on such simpler resources as part-of - speech tagging , simple noun phrase recognition , basic semantic category information like , gender , number , and [ to a limited extent ] full parse trees . such an approach - - trying to explore and maximize everything that can be done simply and cheaply towards the resolution of a complex program - - is perfectly legitimate as long as it is realized that a considerable part of the problem remains unsolved , and it is indeed realized fully well within the muc - 6 initiative . one persistent problem throughout the existing computational ventures into coreference has been the lack of a consistent theoretical approach to it . the result is that coreference phenomena are treated as self-obvious , and most of them are overlooked , especially if they are not explicit pronoun-antecedent or other equally evident anaphora cases . what is needed for a full , accurate , and reliable approach to coreference can be summarized , somewhat schematically , as involving the following steps : 1 . understanding fully the range of the phenomenon and of the rules that govern it ( theory ) ; 2 . determining the extent of machine-tractable information in the rules ; 3 . taking stock of all the rules that can be computed ; 4 . developing the appropriate heuristics for the computable rules ; 5 . computing the rules . workshop agenda the workshop will be held during the morning session of 26 may 1998 and will include a joint address by the organizing committee ( listed above ) , followed by 5 - 8 individual presentations in two 90-120 - minute blocks , with a break provided midway through . call for papers the workshop solicits papers addressing any one or more of the points addressed above as well as any other pertinent issues . papers based on a diversity of languages are encouraged , both one language at a time and , especially , comparative / contrastive studies . also strongly encouraged are papers which extend the study of coreference beyond entity / object reference , across document boundaries , and / or into non-text media . format for submission paper submissions should consist of an extended abstract of approximately 800 words , along with a brief description of the proposed presentation structure ( e . g . , paper , paper plus demo , etc . ) . each submission should include a separate title page , providing the following information : the title to be printed in the conference program ; names and affiliations of all authors ; the full address of the primary author ( or alternate contact person ) , including phone , fax , email ; and required audio-visual equipment . papers may be submitted by sending three hardcopies or one softcopy ( in tex , ascii , or post-script format ) to the appropriate address as listed below : dr . victor raskin chair , interdepartmental program in linguistics heavilon hall purdue university west lafayette , in 47907 usa vraskin @ purdue . edu submissions must be received no later than 1 march 1998 for a 15 march notification of paper acceptance .

 godbole ' s report unearths absurd calculations , maharashtra could use this to wriggle out of the dabhol project , sucheta dalal
 it is finally quit india time for enron . though the controversial multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in dabhol power company ( dpc ) , informed sources say that it has sent feelers to china light it deliberately uses expensive raw material ( ignoring world bank warnings ) , has worked on fanciful demand - supply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions .
 in fact , the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs 930 crore more than it should every year . this comprises overcharging of rs 253 crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per cent of the capacity is used for dpc . there ' s also a rs 100 crore extra billing to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge . by charging more than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government of india , enron collects approximately rs 246 crore extra every year . it has also been collecting rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims . enron has been charging at 1878 kcal / kwh under the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate . this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra .
 the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation : a rate of rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans , rs 34 . 5 per dollar as reference rate for phase - i , rs 39 . 35 per dollar as reference rate for phase - ii and a curious rs 42 per dollar for calculating government of india tariff . forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation . all it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment .
 the godbole committee has established that dpc ' s tariffs can easily be halved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments , the take - or - pay clause and escrow facility ( which is in fact hampering mseb ' s reform particularly in power distribution ) are scrapped . the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system . the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route . it says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous , it should free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside maharashtra . the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government : "" the public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf "" and has recommended that all documents , including contracts related to all independent power projects ( ipps ) , particularly dpc , should be published by the maharashtra government within two months .
 also , having established that demand - supply estimates by the state government were fanciful , the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps . it recommends that such negotiations should be in accordance with the least - cost plan spelt out by the report . this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance ( patalganga ) , mittals ( bhadravati ) , the bses ( saphale ) and others to set up ipps in maharashtra .

 dpc board set to authorise president , enron md to issue notice of termination , sanjay jog
 scrapping of power purchase agreement
 the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) , which has already taken an aggressive posture , has proposed to authorise the enron india managing director k wade cline and dpc president and chief executive officer neil mcgregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and transfer of dabhol project in view of continuing default by the state and central governments and maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .
 the board of directors , which would meet on april 25 in london , also plans to appoint mr cline as its "" true and lawful attorney - in - fact "" and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modifications . top sources told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and / or mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and central governments and mseb under clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa .
 "" in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligations under the ppa , the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee , the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings , "" the company resolution said . "" consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies , the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa from time to time and at any time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company , "" the resolution added .
 according to the resolution , the directors , the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually , are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution , in the name and for and on behalf of the company . against this backdrop , the state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the ppa . the state government and mseb sources said that such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate ( penalty ) of rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january 28 and february 13 .
 the state government and mseb , which reviewed its position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh , are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination notice to the dpc . the dpc ' s move to appoint mr k wade cline as its "" true and lawful attorney - in - fact "" deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit states .
 mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs 64 crore or the equivalent in foreign currency in any financial year . furthermore , mr cline would be in a position to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to the day - to - day operation of the company ' s business or exercise its rights and discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing agreements

 deshmukh and the mseb team are scheduled to meet union finance minister yashwant sinha and power minister suresh prabhu on monday in new delhi to discuss the stalemate and find a acceptable solution for the same . "" i am meeting sinha and prabhu to request them to take an initiative and send representatives for the negotiations committee , "" he said . deshmukh ' s meeting with the centre comes at a crucial stage as dpc ' s lenders would be meeting in london , on the same day , to decide upon the future finances of the controversy marred 2 , 184 - mw project in dabhol .
 moreover , the dpc board is also scheduled to meet on april 25 in london to decide the fate of its $ 900 million project in dabhol , including winding up of its operations . the meeting would discuss the topmost item on the agenda , which was to empower dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up operations in the country . dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore plus interest towards the bills due for the months of december 2000 and january 2001 .
 asked whether the centre had send any feel over a possible clubbing together of the arbitration and conciliation processes , deshmukh replied in the negative . deshmukh said mseb chairman vinay bansal along with two senior officials would attend dpc ' s board meeting in london . bansal had said on sunday that mseb would present its case concerning the rs 401 - crore penalty that the loss - making board slapped on dpc on february 28 , for not generating required power within the stipulated time as per the ppa . currently , enron india holds 65 per cent in the $ 900 - million dpc project , which includes mseb ' s 15 per cent , while general electric and bechtel hold 10 per cent each .

 cm takes enron to delhi today
 chief minister vilasrao deshmukh will discuss the enron imbroglio with union finance minister yashwant sinha and union power minister suresh prabhu in delhi today . he will request the centre to appoint a representative to the committee that the state government is setting up to carry on discussions and negotiations regarding the dabhol power project of the us - based enron power company . today , a special meeting of representatives of all those finanicial institutions which have extended loans to the dabhol power project is also being held in london . a meeting of its directors will be held on wednesday to discuss the fate of the $ 900 million project which has been under a cloud ever since its inception .
 yesterday , mr . prabhu declared at a ' janata darbar ' in thane that the centre would extend all help to solve the enron crisis . this is in the backdrop of pending bills to the tune of rs . 213 crore which the state fowarded to the centre against payments for the months of december 2000 and january 2001 . confirming that there was no proposal from the state government to handover the project to the centre , mr . prabhu said that the situation of the electricity boards in the country was precarious . the centre had decided to assist maharashtra upto rs . 250 crore every year to improve customer services .

 the real story of dabhol if a judicial probe , suggested by the committee , is ordered into the enron deal , it could embarrass three governments ranjit bhushan
 "" the committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken in respect of the enron project at different points of time by successive governments and agencies in the centre and state . ""
 - - energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole
 this could well be the real enron story
 a five - member high - powered committee headed by madhav godbole - and including former union economic affairs secretary e . a . s . sarma , hdfc chairman deepak parekh , teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lal - has recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power project deal saying it signified "" the utter failure of governance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision - making process relating to the dabhol project "" . the report , which was submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook , is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar ( with the congress then ) , the 13 - day bjp - led union government which reworked the deal in 1996 , shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi
 "" the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decision - making relating to the dabhol project . "" madhav godbole committee report
 an investigation , if ordered , could embarrass at least these three governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal . according to the committee , the deal reveals failure of governance , both at the centre and state , and across different agencies . "" it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental , "" the report said , proposing a set of measures to be implemented if something of the project was to be retrieved . godbole and sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry . this was finally adopted by it . says a congress leader : "" enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation , particularly in the power sector . ""
 the proposal has already struck panic . says ncp ' s praful patel : "" if the enron decision has at all been detrimental , it is because of the haste with which phase 2 was cleared by the shiv sena - bjp government . now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron , the important thing is to resolve it amicably . a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it ' s not an issue of corruption but that of perception . ""
 pro - market congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the centre and the state which invited enron , even though the second phase was cleared by the bjp - shiv sena combine . says congress spokesperson jaipal reddy : "" right now we ' re too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka . "" pro - liberalisation congress mps also fear that such witch - hunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors . non - congress mps from maharashtra , meanwhile , claim that the godbole committee was instituted with the express purpose of politicising the enron issue . "" i think i know vilasrao deshmukh ' s gameplan , "" says an mp from the state . but some mps like congress ' prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that ' s surrounded the deal : "" i ' ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this "" .
 the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a techno - economic appraisal , as envisaged under provisions of the electricity supply act of 1948 and related legislations , the infirmities could have been avoided . since this wasn ' t done , questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise , the exhaustive 93 - page report points out .
 "" i ' d highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit , "" says congress mp prithviraj chavan .
 the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early ' 90 s and , despite several controversies , is now an established power project at dabhol , 150 km south of mumbai . in july 1992 , enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) to set up a 2 , 550 mw station as part of the government ' s ' fast track ' projects .
 subsequently , when the shiv - sena - bjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project . this curiously led to renegotiations with enron . the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal . "" once it ( gom ) decided to revive the project , it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done . it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency . the speed with which the negotiating group studied the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons , which was accepted by dabhol , is unprecedented . "" says chavan : "" i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned . ""
 since the commissioning of the plant in may 1999 , the mseb has paid rs 1 , 607 crore for the power it has bought from dabhol . if the same watttage of power had been bought from indian - built power plants fired by indigenous coal , the payment would have been approximately rs 736 crore . in the first year - and - a - half of its operation itself , the dpc had drained the maharashtra exchequer of nearly rs 1 , 000 crore .
 the central electricity authority ( cea ) , in fact , pointed out that the dabhol plant was not the least costly option . the mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda , but they were in a preliminary stage . the report notes : "" . . . if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects , they might not have remained in their preliminary stages "" . it adds that the members were of the opinion that "" the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously , based on information available at that time , in proceeding with the dpc as a base - load factor even when its capacity was reduced . "" the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry , finance ministry and the cea . it quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable , no further examination was required
 strangely , bal thackeray ' s shiv sena , when it came to power together with the bjp in maharashtra , filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal .
 after the new shiv sena - bjp government took over , its cm , manohar joshi , appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises , actually managing to reduce the tariff . but certain things remained inexplicable . no fresh clearances were required from the cea , which also said that "" since no cost increase was involved . . . fresh formal clearance wasn ' t necessary . "" says the committee : "" this only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didn ' t consider the economic aspects of the project at all . indeed , given the non - availability of any official record of the meeting on june 24 , 1994 , with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december 23 , 1994 , the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discussed at all . ' '
 the credibility of the shiv sena - bjp government has been seriously questioned . "" the committee finds it unexplicable ( sic ) why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $ 2 , 828 million to $ 2 , 501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committee , "" the panel observes . says lawyer prashant bhushan : "" it is strange that the shiv sena - bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal . "" the committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal . "" subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc , the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid . while the mseb was in profit in 1998 - 99 , it plunged into huge losses of rs 1681 crore in 1999 - 2000 . ""
 significantly , the world bank in 1993 had predicted the system ' s inherent weaknesses . in a letter written to the then power secretary , r . vasudevan , a top bank official had said that "" after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions , we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project , as presently formulated , is not economically justified "" and that in "" our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system in 1998 . the proposed base - load operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch , as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power . ""
 enron ' s persistence and the ' gullibility ' of the indian side can be gauged from high - ranking enron official joe sutton ' s letter to a key indian official , ajit nimbalkar : "" i recently met with the world bank and have been following the articles in the india papers . i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed . we ' ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from here on . the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington . ""
 the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all ? for the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project . according to the report , the mseb has been one of the better performing boards in the country and has , despite a faulty transmission and distribution ( t and d ) system , managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis .
 maharashtra accounts for nearly one - fourth of the gross value of india ' s industrial sector . it ' s one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent electrification . since ' 95 , the mseb has been adding to its generation . "" this improvement , which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb , exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was being considered , "" the report points out . following a policy of cross - subsidy , roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised .
 but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn ' t been much . in fact , the subsidy claim decreased from rs 630 crore in 1995 - 96 to rs 355 crore in 1998 - 99 , until in 1999 - 2000 it increased nearly five - fold to rs 2 , 084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per unit - from 15 to 41 paise - an increase of 173 per cent . "" the increase in the subsidy claim by rs 1 , 729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because of the increase in power purchase costs , "" says the committee , adding : "" without the dpc and without problems of t and d loss , the mseb could be financially healthy . ""
 but can that happen now since enron is here to stay ? the committee has come up with some far - reaching recommendations : make public all dabhol - related documents and agreements , restructure the dabhol project itself to bring down the cost of power , restructure dpc financially , allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra , re - examine ppas in accordance with least - cost plans , and thoroughly reform the mseb . the committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion . the question is , can that be achieved in an unstable political environment ?

 mseb revenue collections up at rs 968 crore in march , renni abraham
 the maharashtra state electricity board ' s ( mseb ) revenue collections in march 2001 stood at a record rs 968 crore . this was largely due to the disconnection drive on defaulter connections - - pegged at nearly 20 , 000 disconnections a month - - which resulted in compliance by consumers . with the dabhol power company ( dpc ) monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table , the mseb has turned to putting its house in order .
 as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis , the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record . for instance , mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march 31 , 2001 , at 45930 units , compared with the previous year ' s 45582 units , making it the top seb of the country in this respect . similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at 86 . 1 up from 84 . 6 per cent last fiscal . plant load factor is up to 72 . 78 per cent , compared with 71 . 7 per cent in 2000 .
 the parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units , which made it eligible for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs 12 . 5 lakh . all other power stations in the state , without exception , also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award , a senior mseb official said . similarly , the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any state electricity board to get the iso 9002 certification .
 a senior mseb official said : "" earlier mseb was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning . the agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals , while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head . in the recent past , the government has authorised mseb to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials , many of whom , including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions"

 call for papers ijcai-95 workshop on context in natural language processing august 19 , 20 , or 21 , 1995 montreal , canada correct interpretation of natural language utterances and texts requires linguistic and non-linguistic context . the goal of this workshop is to investigate the nature of context in natural language , its role in natural language processing , and shed some light on this largely unexplored area of great theoretical and practical importance . dialogue and text processing are two application domains where the lack of good theories of context impedes significant progress in applying and developing new technologies . as speech technology matures , it becomes technically feasible to build dialogue systems . however , understanding dialogues , and especially multimodal dialogues , is not possible without some account of the role of context . similarly , with today 's text processing technology it is feasible to automatically create knowledge bases from fairly unconstrained texts such as newspaper archives . ignoring context in such texts , however , results in knowledge bases that are not only very incomplete , but also dramatically different from knowledge bases created by humans , based on the same texts . we invite papers from researchers active in the fields of natural language processing , knowledge representation , and other related areas addressing theoretical aspects of context and their implications for designing practical nlp systems . we are interested in reports on implemented nlp systems utilizing contextual information . we are also interested in knowledge representation systems , inference methods , and algorithms that would allow one to computationally handle specific aspects of context . agenda : our workshop will provide answers and insights into how to go about answering a number of questions , including the following : i : role of context in natural language what is context ? what is "" context of the previous utterance / sentence "" "" context of the dialog-so - far / text-so - far "" and what is the relationship between them ? how many different contexts are there ? what makes two contexts different ? what is the relationship between formalization of context and natural language ideas of context ? what is the status of context in a formal representation aiming at truthfully capturing all the characteristics of natural language ? is context an inherent characteristic of natural language that ultimately decides the formal power of natural language ? is natural language minus context a less powerful formal language ? does representing context and truthfully capturing characteristics of natural language require new knowledge representation or automated reasoning systems ? what is the relationship between context , and the semantics and pragmatics of natural language ? is context different from possible worlds and situations ? what is the relationship between domain ontologies and contexts ? ii : context-dependent interpretation of natural language in which way does context affect interpretation of natural language utterances and texts ? which aspects of context or which contexts result in refined , more general , and different interpretations of natural language ? which aspects of context are explicit and which are implicit in natural language utterances and texts ? which phenomena and inferences observed in natural language are context-independent and which ones always depend on context ? iii : computability does handling context increase or decrease computational complexity of natural language processing ? how to automatically identify context-provided constraints resulting in conveying and understanding additional or different aspects of information ? how to represent those extra constraints provided by context and how to automatically compute context-dependent interpretation of natural language ? should the final interpretation of natural language be decontextualized when stored in a knowledge base ? how can information obtained in one context be utilized in another , possibly unanticipated context ? workshop format : we will hold four sessions : i : role of context in natural language ii : context - dependent interpretation of natural language iii : computability iv : general discussion sessions i , ii , and iii will be mildly structured : first , the committee will present a brief overview of possible answers to the specific questions included in the agenda , and discuss their own answers . this presentation will be mixed with questions from the participants . second , the participants whose papers were accepted will briefly comment on their own answers to these questions . these presentations will also be mixed with questions from the participants . session iv , a general discussion , will give each participant a chance to make a statement about any context-related issue , make a comment , raise a question , argue for or against some answers etc . pre-worshop activities : a pre-workshop mailing list will be established ; please , indicate whether you want to be included ; in order to facilitate interaction and focus the discussion , two months before the workshop , we will provide all the participants with specific examples and data illustrating various aspects of context . authors + titles + abstracts of the accepted papers , but not the papers themselves , will be available on-line to everybody . the papers will only be available to the workshop participants . we hope that this will encourage people to make strong claims even if the support for them is not quite there , report on partial , ongoing , promising research , be frank in evaluating existing approaches and their own accomplishments , openly comment on limitations , in short , say all those ( very ) informative things that are sometimes difficult , if not impossible , to communicate in "" official "" publications . shared data , references , papers and the mailing list are to allow the participants to : - sort out as many as possible things before the workshop - help focusing the workshop discussion on the hardest and most controversial issues - raise objections and bring up controversial claims early on in order to prepare well thought of answers and constructive critique participants : a limited number , 30 or so , active participants will be selected on the basis of submitted papers . a small number , 5 or so , of no-paper -

against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red
Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching
alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the
dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply ""./configure
--with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver"" from the
alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under
/tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run ""depmod -a"".Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed
drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own
kernel.I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's
what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a
kernel recompiled with ACPI.Matthias--

 as i mentioned to you , due to some recent success in obtaining additional security , we are extending credit to edison mission marketing & trading , inc . to transact on the day ahead and balance of week markets only . we will not be granting them execution rights on eol due to the lack of controls / functionality for daily transactions . eol , unlike ice , has tenor function set by months versus number of days . as a result , in the case of edison mission , if we set eol for one month , edison would have access to balance of the month plus next month . it seems to make this work for edison and perhaps other potential counterparties , it would either require reengineering of the system or possibly coming up with dividing the products to incorporate daily transactions . if you would like to discuss further , please call .

 opportunity to vote for college as well as local high school football
 polls . this is long over due as the football alumni more than all other
 bodies will give the most realistic evaluation of teams . further to
 providing a voice , it has been long needed to have an organization like

 and high school football , as well as providing input on national issues
 such as schools and leagues dropping or changing there support of football
 and the student athletes .

 kinmen hsien , fukien . taiwan
 r . o . c .
 i am mr . chan fung , bank manager of land bank , kincheng branch , fukien , taiwan . r . o . c . i have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you .
 on june 6 , 1999 , a british oil consultant / contractor with the chinese solid minerals corporation , mr . smith lawrence made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for twelve calendar months , valued at us $ 30 , 000 , 000 . 00 ( thirty million dollars ) in my branch . upon maturity , i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers , the chinese solid minerals corporation that mr . smith lawrence died from an automobile accident . on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless .
 i therefore made further investigation and discovered that mr . smith lawrence did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents , including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank . this sum of us $ 30 , 000 , 000 . 00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . no one will ever come forward to claim it . according to laws of republic of china , at the expiration of 5 ( five ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the chinese government if nobody applies to claim the fund .
 consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to mr . smith lawrence so that the fruits of this old man ' s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials . this is simple , i will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin . we shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate / administration in your favor for the transfer . a bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary / next of kin . the money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 90 % for me and 10 % for you .
 there is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction . if you are interested , please reply immediately via this email address immediately . upon your response , i shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction . please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication .
 please observe utmost confidentiality , and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country . awaiting your urgent reply .
 thanks and regards ,
 mr . chan fung .

 kevin ,
 i was talking with louise this afternoon and she said that she does not want us to put full master agreements online , but rather that we should proceed with streamlined gtc ' s in order to ensure that we are able to do as much business as possible without being delayed by negotiation of lengthy contracts .
 this does not mean that we cannot ultimately get everyone onto a standardised long - form master agreement . enrononline is set up so that a negotiated master agreement will supercede the gtc .

 hello ,
 did you ejaculate before or within a few minutes of

 premature ejaculation occurs when you ejaculate too quickly
 and without control . it occurs before or shortly after
 penetration . premature ejaculation interferes with the sexual
 pleasure of both you and your partner . it causes feelings of
 guilt , embarrassment , frustration , and depression .

 houston , feb . 15 / prnewswire - firstcall / - - kinder morgan energy partners , l . p . ( nyse : kmp ) and calpine corporation ( nyse : cpn ) today announced the termination of the proposed sonoran pipeline project . the sonoran pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions . securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin . neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004 .
 both kmp and calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing california market .
 phase i of the proposed sonoran pipeline would have extended from the blanco hub and terminated near needles and topock , calif . , with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern california .
 based in san jose , calif . , calpine corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean , efficient , natural gas - fired power generation . it generates and markets power , through plants it develops , owns and operates , in 29 states in the united states , three provinces in canada and in the united kingdom . calpine also is the world ' s largest producer of renewable geothermal energy , and it owns 1 . 3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in canada and the united states . the company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cpn . for more information about calpine , visit its website at www . calpine . com .
 kinder morgan energy partners , l . p . is the nation ' s largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $ 9 billion . kmp owns and operates more than 20 , 000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals . its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4 . 3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas . its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals . kmp is also the leading provider in the u . s . of co 2 , which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects ."

open-source some time in 2000, so my information likely was correct
at the time I compiled that list.In addition, please note that, just because a company decides to go open
source with a codebase as of some new release version, that doesn't make
all versions ever released open source retroactively.  A licence
attaches to a _copy_ of a creative work.  So, if there was a
proprietary, non-redistributable copy in SuSE boxed sets, it's still
proprietary and non-redistributable -- unless SAP AG decided to mail out
a separate permission grant for it.

> availible to other OSes to make themselves different from the competitionI think the words you are looking for are ""competitive advantage"" or
""differentiation"".Since most Linux vendors are businesses, they need to make money to
survive[1]. To make money they need to sell products. To ensure they sell
their product, they must provide something that other vendors do not.The down side is that this produces many variations of the same product. The
benefit of open source is that there is a common standard which everyone can
share. (The up side is that the competition drives the different
organisations to constantly improve their product offering[2].)So unlike SunOS vs AIX vs HPUX vs Tru64, where the API's and available
functionality were often starkly different, Linux distributions are mostly
the same.While I may have to look in /var/named on Red Hat, and /etc/bind on Debian,
the binaries are basically the same, as are the man pages. In most cases,
doing a ""man named"" will reveal the compiled location of the config files.
So long as this is understood, it is easy enough to administer most Linux
distributions.I expect that as companies and public sector organisations begin to
understand the open source paradigm, you will find even more distributions
appearing. The reason I believe this is that deriving a new distribution
from, say, Debian requires comparatively little effort. I would see this
requiring slightly more effort than the amount of time many enterprise
admins spend trying to customise the desktops, screen savers and software
distribution mechanisms of their own organisations.IMHO, as always...
- Matthew[1] Depending on your world view, this may be rephrased as ""they need to
make oodles of profits and screw the little man to survive."" This discussion
is beyond the scope of this list. :)[2] The often overlooked problem with competition is that it weakens the
""combatants"", leaving the field open for a less powerful force to take over
and entrench its position (in this case I would be referring to Microsoft).
However, I do not believe this will effect the Linux movement as all the
vendors are obliged to work together to a great degree, thanks to the GPL.__________________________________________________

 current price : o . o 9

 like momentum .
 breaking news ! !
 may 18 - - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
 announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications
 commission ( crtc ) that they wouid regulate voice over internet protocol
 ( voip ) service oniy when it is provided and used as | oca | teiephone
 service .
 in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to buiid
 sustainabie competition in local teiephone markets , the incumbent carriers
 wi | | not be permitted to price their loca | voip services below cost to
 stifle competition .
 the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
 the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
 cable companies and virtual operators . the ruiing permits us to enter the
 market with a competitive framework , stated jan oiiver , ceo of nomad
 international inc .
 the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
 products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though
 broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utiiization
 woridwide , dia | - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
 u . s . aione , there are over 2 oo , oo 0 , 000 users of the internet . of the
 tota | users in the u . s . , the total number of users of broadband is oniy
 approximateiy 4 o , ooo , oo 0 ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore
 represents approximately 8 o % of the entire internet connectivity market .
 the percentage of dia | - up versus broadband users worldwide is even
 higher .
 nomad ' s abiiity to offer voip products to dia | - up customers and service
 providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
 but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
 by offering a unique , proprietary and easiiy adaptable product .
 about nomad international inc .
 nomad international inc . is a muiti - nationa | internet communications
 company deveioping cost effective teiecommunications through voice over
 internet protoco | ( voip ) technoiogies . the company ' s revoiutionary voip
 product | ine called nomad systems that has dia | - up , broadband , dsl ,
 cabie , sateliite and wireless capabiiities . the company pians on
 targeting : 1 ) nationa | fixed line ii iii tier carriers which are interested in
 effectiveiy competing with the dominant carrier in their marketpiace ,
 2 ) large muitinational corporations which need to have us or european
 presence by having , ( for exampie ) , a united states number ringing in
 their offices in guatemaia or london - - offering business partners a more
 economica | way to communicate , and 3 ) immigrants in north america , a
 means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their

0,"Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):> What is the GPL all about then?(1) I'm sure you are not _actually_ under the delusion that everything
on a typical Linux distribution issued subject to the terms of the GNU
GPL.  For one thing, it seems difficult to imagine you _not_ being aware
that XFree86 is under the X/MIT licence, that Perl is under the Perl
Artistic Licence, that Apache is under the Apache licence, and that
numerous BSD utilities are under the BSD licence.Furthermore, xv, Acrobat Reader, pine, pico, Netscape Communicator, and
a whole slew of other applications typically included aren't under any
open source licence at all, but rather are proprietary.(2) You seem, in any event, to be under a misconception as to what the
GPL provides, as to code under its umbrella.  It says (in part) that
_if_ you have lawfully received a copy of covered binary code, then you
may insist on one of certain forms of access to the matching source
code.  Please note that it does _not_ guarantee you any rights
whatsoever if nobody's decided to give you a lawful copy.> But *_surely_* they cannot BSD Linux? It's not theirs to BSD!Again, you seem to be under a misconception.  If you check, I'm quite
confident you'll see that SuSE are in full compliance with GPL v. 2's
source-code access provisions concerning GPLed code included in their
distribution.  And no, nobody has the legal right to alter licence terms
to someone else's copyrighted property.  But you have not cited any
reasons to believe that SuSE have done any of those things.
 
> Fine - nobody can oblige SuSE to do anything other than put up the ftp

SuSE Linux AG are rather unlikely to knock down your door and haul you
down to a judge, if that's what you're asking.> Nobody can oblige them to give away anything other than ftp - I'm not
> asking for that. I'm asking for somebody who has Linux (GPL'ed) to
> burn a copy for me and give it to me in exchange for a reasonable
> consideration (say, the price of the CDs and a bottle of Frascati or a
> couple of pints?).You appear confused between Linux the kernel (which is a copyrighted
work to which source code access is guaranteed under the GNU GPL if
you've received a lawful copy of a binary version) and the rather
imprecise concept of a ""Linux distribution"", which is a number of works
under diverse licence terms collected onto some media.In the case of SuSE's boxed sets -- which are NOT lawful to duplicate
and redistribute in their entirety -- at least a couple of the
applications on them (YaST, YaST2, and the installer program) are
proprietary copyrighted works of SuSE Linux AG.  In the general case,
duplicating and redistributing CD-ROMs containing those works is
copyright infringement.  Illegal.  No amount of hand-waving about the
GNU GPL is going to change that.(SuSE permit people to duplicate and redistribute the ""evaluation"" and
""live-eval"" CD editions, despite that fact, as long as it is not ""for
value"".)If you want to have a SuSE boxed set to install from, buy one.> What does the GPL mean now?Suggestion:  Read it.  I would guess you've not yet done so.-- 
Cheers,                                             Live Faust, die Jung.

0,"Subject: open letter to * language *
 
 sally 's posting in response to the open letter indicates that * language * has decided to have illich - svitych 's book reviewed . that is good news - - unless this refers merely to the fact that late in 1990 or early in 1991 she asked eric hamp to do a review , which to my knowlege he declined to do . if indeed eric hamp is now going to review the book , i will be delighted . but it is not the case ( as some have charged ) that the open letter was written in spite of the fact that the signers knew , or could have found out , that a review was in the works . we were informed that hamp had declined . as recently as march 7 , 1994 , the language advisory committee seemed to have no knowledge of such a review . in response to an appeal from me , the committee urged that * language * do something on this issue , but in july * language * informed me that it would not . this , together with the fact that the incoming editor of * language * told me that he would have to stand by his predecessor 's decision ( something i can quite sympathize with ) is what prompted not just me but a number of distinguished members of the linguistic society to resort to the idea of an open letter . far from wishing to be divisive , i ( and others ) have tried since 1990 to address what we perceived to be a major omission , and to address it without public fanfare . however , this has had no effect . i report this with all due respect to the achievements of * language * under sally 's editorship , respect which i am sure is widely shared . it seems to me that a request that she change an editorial decision can in no way harm that distinguished record . alexis manaster ramer p . s . since the original posting , the following people have asked to have their names added to the signatories of the letter : edith moravcsik sebastian shaumyan david stampe daniel radzinski lloyd b . anderson - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - moderators ' message : we are taking the unaccustomed step of commenting on a discussion , because it 's christmas and we would love to encourage peace on ( the linguistic ) earth if we could . with regard to a review of illich - svitych 's work , all parties agree that : a ) * language * commissioned a review in 1991 b ) the original review is now unlikely to come in to us , these facts suggest both that ( a ) * language * acted fairly in soliciting discussion of nostratic and ( b ) the signers of the open letter acted in good faith in requesting another review . the linguistic issue here is the merit ( or non-merit ) of the book . if subscribers would like to address this issue after the break , we ' ll be happy to post such messages . otherwise , this discussion is closed . peace ! helen & anthony postscript : since it 's difficult to discuss a book no one has read , we would like to remind you that the book was announced on linguist as "" available for discussion .

start a shell with a minimal build environment, logged with script. The

documented values from one's environment for use in the build (CC, ARCH,
various LD_* variables) this kind of thing is necessary.Often the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no .profile
for building stuff.Cheers,

 executive summary
 ? the likely outcome of the 16 may elections is a victory by the bc liberal party ( currently holding polls at 70 % ) , a pro - business , right - of - center party led by gordon campbell .
 ? major changes in british columbia energy policy are likely under a liberal government .
 ? a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed by us power consumers could force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire
 ? bc hydro ' s additional generation at williston is likely undeliverable
 liberal party platform
 ? income tax cut that would make bc ' s income tax the lowest in canada
 ? independent audit of the province ' s books amid allegations of ndp mismanagement and incompetence
 ? review of all crown corporations ( including bc hydro ) to enhance efficiency and management quality
 ? campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the corporate capital tax , the machinery equipment tax and the corporate income tax .
 energy agenda
 according to sources , under the liberal party ' s rule , significant changes in the bc government ' s energy policy could include a move toward the privatization of some bc hydro assets , perhaps including its transmission assets , as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coal - fired production . at the same time , a rate review and attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the province ' s overall energy strategy over the next few years . campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coal - fired production . campbell calls thermal coal , "" an asset that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in bc . "" a high - ranking ndp source believes that campbell will take the province back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new technology . the source expects this to lead to strong protests from environmentalists . "" these are confrontational moves , and people will be on the streets . ""
 campbell ' s most likely choice for energy minister is richard neufeldt , though we caution that this decision depends on the make - up of the legislature after the election . neufeldt is responsible for the liberal party ' s energy , mining and northern development portfolio . sources speculate that if right - wing liberals are dissatisfied with the party ' s performance after the may election , neufeldt could again defect to the opposition . however , this gives campbell even greater incentive to name neufeldt energy minister , a high - profile position .
 should the liberals win the election , gordon campbell has indicated that he would return bc hydro to regulation by the bc utilities commission . the bc government has derived $ 5 . 5 billion in revenue from bc hydro since 1991 ( roughly 85 percent of its profit ) . critics say this has undermined the utility ' s ability to pay down approximately $ 7 . 5 billion in debt and invest in the future . this also has left hydro without a rate stabilization fund , something that sources feel may be needed this year . campbell reportedly intends to address these issues , and one can expect this to lead to calls for change .
 electricity export policy
 currently the bc utilities commission is demanding more information about bc hydro ' s out - of - province sales . the commission has warned that , given the low snow pack , the utility could be a net importer of power this year . supporting this view , the northwest power planning council , representing bc hydro ' s key trading partners in the us , has said that it would not be able to rely upon british columbia or alberta during peak consumption periods over the next few years , and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses . the combination of a low snow pack , a return to regulation by the bc utilities commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed to bc hydro by us consumers may force bc hydro to stop out - of - province power sales once existing contracts expire .
 bc hydro privatization
 a key campaign energy issue for the liberal party is the privatization of bc hydro . campbell has urged greater electricity competition , saying , "" we need to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all , producers and consumers , on an equal and non - discriminatory basis . "" he stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn . "" i want to change that big time , "" he told the canadian institute of energy . campbell also urged more natural gas development , including pipelines and co - generation plants .
 campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by ndp leader ujjal dosanjh . campbell stated on 25 april , "" we have no intention of selling bc hydro ; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines , no intention of selling their dams , we have no intention of selling their reservoirs . "" liberal party spokesman mike morton also reiterated on 29 april that bc hydro would not be for sale . a high - level ndp source commented that campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding bc hydro , essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams , transmission lines or generating stations , but that he is in favor of opening the sector up to competition .
 however , local sources believe that some parts of bc hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of bc crown corporations to enhance efficiency . likely sale prospects include bc hydro ' s distribution channels and its energy trading subsidiary , powerex . in addition , gary farrell - collins , the liberal finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister ( after neufeldt ) , has stated that public ownership of bc hydro ' s non - core businesses , such as westech , its systems division , and customer billing , could come under review .
 bc hydro williston generation
 current reservoirs levels at bc hydro ' s williston hydro - generation facility are at 2 , 150 ft , which allows bc hydro to drop levels another 35 ft ( 170 gwhs / ft ) under their current permit . the one drawback to this plan ' s additional generation involves the mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease operation if water levels were to fall below 2 , 140 ft . sources close to the minister of mines & energy - elect , richard neufeldt , indicate that levels at williston probably will not be drawn down below mackenzie ' s operational limits due to concern over political backlash ."

although there probably is since Red Hat decided to default disabling it a

Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it,
it simply don't be able to make the change, and that's it. The problem IIRC
is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as

Indeed - that I actually had understood prior
to all this - for example commercial entities
with trial/limited/crippled editions. Which is no problem - I don't see why that should
be a problem for SuSE though - surely the 
more the merrrier as far as they're concerned.

Vide supra.

Mighty white of you, old bean.

One can suspect what one likes. What I didn't 
understand was that SuSE had proprietary 
extensions that it wasn't prepared to allow
people to use under the GPL or even under  a
FreeBSD style licence.
I thought that the model for the likes of 
SuSE was selling support and customisation, 
rather than what I thought of as the core
""product"". I thought that the likes of Yast
came under core - maybe it worked in the glory
days before, say, 2001 - I can understand that
they might want to make more money, but the way
in which they have done it, seems to me, to be 
be against the spirit of the GPL.

could be received for the cost of the media plus
a token of one's appreciation (the latter being
subject to agreement between the parties) - I was
offering a bottle of wine plus maybe a pint or two
and a chat for a copy - I don't know what the going
rate is.
If I wanted support from SuSE, that would be a
different issue, and one for which I would be
willing to pay.

I have a friend with 7.3 - I think that I'll

the GPL though.

I have now realised this, thanks to your kind
explanations. I can borrow them, but not 
copy them? That's fine - IMHO, it goes against
the spirit of the GPL though.

And, as I've tried to explain, is not the licence
terms on, say, trials for commercial company x
to which I object, it is the way SuSE appears, 
at least to my I.T. peasant self, to have
mixed up proprietary and open stuff.

And I have no problem with people sticking trial
editions along with GPL'ed stuff. Why you 
can't pass those on though, is beyond me.

 subject : duke meeting - pluto line
 importance : high
 i met with stephen noe over lunch yesterday to discuss the sale of the pluto gathering line . as per our internal meeting on wednesday , i questioned stephen about duke ' s evaluation based upon the data provided thus far . enron has provided duke with the gathering agreement which contains the guaranteed revenue stream . i informed stephen that enron would like to know a notional type value for the pluto gathering line . we both recognized that the value would be highly dependent upon the discount factor being applied to the revenue stream .
 stephen informed me that duke ' s evaluation to date showed a value in the $ 14 to 15 mm range . stephen stated that management had not reviewed that evaluation . however , based upon the notional value duke has derived , it appears that duke is using a discount factor very similar to the factor enron is using . i stated that there should be some reserve upside and future option value .
 based upon this discussion with duke , i would recommend that we proceed with setting up a mariner meeting to review geophysical data and begin trying to get marathon approval for release of the production handing agreement ( pha ) . i will contact richard clark regarding the pha .
 if you have any questions please give me a call at ext . 33541 .
 thanks . . . kevin"

find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
now.If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest

 subject : var numbers for the 26 th
 hi andreas ,
 i have run the var model for the 26 th july and have attached a zip file of
 the results :
 the total var is $ 4 , 170 , 653 and the cu position is $ 1 , 852 , 876 .
 i have had trouble getting hold of you so i thought i would summarised what i
 wanted to talk about ( also i thought
 i would give your ears a rest ! )
 basically it is wrt the second point in your mail yesterday ( we briefly
 discussed it earlier ) .
 the fax you sent me to explain the risk calculation suggested that you use a
 5 day period of adjustment to calculate
 the risk ( in this case it is called capital at risk ) . the var calculation for
 our model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factor
 will be reduced by a factor equal the sqrt ( 5 ) or 2 . 24 .
 since :
 old risk factor ( % ) = 1 . 65 * ( std of the price movement ) = 3 . 99 %
 new daily risk factor = 3 . 99 / 2 . 24 = 1 . 78 % which actually equates to std
 of approx 1 . 1 % a day .
 i am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol we
 are showing for cu is approx 19 % which equates to approx 1 . 2 % daily .
 using this new risk factor for the daily var the cu positions would give a
 var ( for the 19 th ) of approx $ 2 m which is less that the
 figure we estimated ( $ 3 , 100 , 568 ) .
 the other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the term
 structure of the price curve / vol curve and position
 curve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which means
 that it is difficult to compare the numbers .
 i hope that this helps to explain our number .
 hopefully we can talk tomorrow ,
 cheers
 kirstee"

it might.  and that was my point, having these mythical symlinks point
to the device+inode is not simple.  just like the unrm thing, it might
be possible, but hard links and soft links are the best implementations
that have survived to date on unix.  windows shortcuts are kinda weird -
they're really an application level thing.mac aliases seem to take the idea of unix symlinks (linking by filename)
along with the concept of device+inode.  i don't know mac internals,
but i seem to remember being told it tried the former first, and then
tried the latter.  how it would deal with the 2nd example i mentioned i
dunno - i'm not certain if the mac version of inodes would suffer from
that (maybe the fs identifier for the file included the creation time
or something like that).> how do i control this 'symlinks magically link to new files' feature?i think it would be difficult.  it would also fail to work in numerous
situations.kevin--

0,"Hi,This has been hashed over a few times on various lists, now I finally got 
around to doing something about it... You can now add
""rpm http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/ redhat/8.0 task"" to your sources.list 
and after apt-get update you can find out what's available with 
'apt-cache search ^task-'These are generated directly from comps.xml of RH8.0 so they contain 
exactly the same packages as you'll get by choosing the various categories 
at install time. I didn't bother including SRPMS for these as they are 
rather uninteresting, if you want you can re-generate the .specs by 
running http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/comps2task/comps2task.py.BTW the repository only contains the task-packages, you'll need an 
apt-enabled mirror of RH8.0 in your sources.list to actually do anything 
with it.--

 a man asked his wife what she ' d like for her birthday .
 "" i ' d love to be six again , "" she replied .
 on the morning of her birthday , he got her up bright and early and off
 they went to a local theme park . what a day ! he put her on every
 ride in the park : the death slide , the screaming loop , the wall of fear -
 everything there was ! wow ! five hours later she staggered out of the
 theme park , her head reeling and her stomach upside down . right to a
 mcdonald ' s they went , where he husband ordered a big mac for her along
 with extra fries and refreshing chocolate shake . then it was off to a
 movie - the latest star wars !
 what a fabulous adventure ! finally she wobbled home with her husband
 and collapsed into bed .
 he leaned over and lovingly asked , "" well , dear ; what was it like being
 six again ? ""
 one eye opened , "" you idiot , i meant my dress size . ""
 the moral of this story is : if a woman speaks and a man is there to
 hear her , he will get it wrong anyway ."

0,"Subject: sundance b bid from duke
 john / louise / rob :
 i thought i would fire off a quick note to inform you that duke produced a non - binding bid for the entire sundance b ppa . duke ' s bid is c $ 180 , 000 , 000 . this compares to an earlier bid of c $ 120 , 000 , 000 to c $ 140 , 000 , 000 for one unit on july 10 , 2001 . duke ' s bid combined with the cost structure of the ppa would have duke buying the ppa for approximately c $ 35 . 50 / mw or us $ 22 . 50 / mw .
 the mark - to - market value of both the sundance units as of september 18 th ' s curves was c $ 178 , 120 , 374 . therefore , a sale to duke at c $ 180 mm would not provide any significant increase to earnings . additionally , it must be noted that the curves have some very conservative heat rate assumptions built into to the latter years .
 based on a conversation with john last week , he clearly indicated that selling the ppa for under us $ 25 . 00 / mw is not acceptable . i would agree with john that enron would better be served by maintaining its current position than accept a bid reflecting a price less than us $ 25 . 00 . it must be noted that duke ' s bid expires at 5 : 00 pm cdt , september 21 . therefore , if anyone feels strongly that we should move forward with duke we should address it immediately . otherwise , don miller and i continue to position enron for the division of the ppa and subsequent auction .

0,"i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks?anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.-h>From: ""Rob Shavell""

1,"Subject: [ ilug ] earn 100 . 000 $ in one year working at home
 hello
 you may have seen this business before and
 ignored it . i know i did - many times ! however ,
 please take a few moments to read this letter .
 i was amazed when the profit potential of this
 business finally sunk in . . . and it works !
 with easy - to - use e - mail tools and opt - in e - mail ,
 success in this business is now fast , easy and
 well within the capabilities of ordinary people
 who know little about internet marketing . and the
 earnings potential is truly staggering !
 i ' ll make you a promise . read this e - mail to the end ! -
 follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
 worry whether a recession is coming or not , who is
 president , or whether you keep your current job or not .
 yes , i know what you are thinking . i never responded
 to one of these before either . one day though ,
 something just said : "" you throw away $ 25 . 00 going to
 a movie for 2 hours with your wife . what the heck . ""
 believe me , no matter where you believe those "" feelings ""
 come from , i thank every day that i had that feeling .
 i cannot imagine where i would be or what i would be
 doing had i not . read on . it ' s true . every word of it .
 it is legal . i checked . simply because you are buying
 and selling something of value .
 as seen on national tv :
 making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
 months from your home .
 thanks to the computer age and the internet !
 be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! !
 before you say "" bull "" , please read the following .
 this is the letter you have been hearing about on the
 news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on
 the internet , a national weekly news program recently
 devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
 program described below , to see if it really can make
 people money . the show also investigated whether or
 not the program was legal .
 their findings proved once and for all that there are
 "" absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in
 the program and if people can ' follow the simple
 instructions ' they are bound to make some mega bucks
 with only $ 25 out of pocket cost "" .
 due to the recent increase of popularity & respect
 this program has attained , it is currently working
 better than ever .
 this is what one had to say : "" thanks to this
 profitable opportunity . i was approached many times
 before but each time i passed on it . i am so glad
 i finally joined just to see what one could expect
 in return for the minimal effort and money required .
 to my astonishment , i received a total $ 610 , 470 . 00
 in 21 weeks , with money still coming in . ""
 pam hedland , fort lee , new jersey .
 another said : "" this program has been around for a
 long time but i never believed in it . but one day
 when i received this again in the mail i decided
 to gamble my $ 25 on it . i followed the simple
 instructions and walaa . . . . . 3 weeks later the
 money started to come in . first month i only made
 $ 240 . 00 but the next 2 months after that i made
 a total of $ 290 , 000 . 00 . so far , in the past 8 months
 by re - entering the program , i have made over
 $ 710 , 000 . 00 and i am playing it again . the key to
 success in this program is to follow the simple
 steps and not change anything . ""
 more testimonials later but first , = = = = = = =
 = = = = print this now for your future reference = = = =
 if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every
 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably , please read the
 following . . . then read it again and again ! ! !
 follow the simple instruction below and
 your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed !
 instructions :
 = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = =
 for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the
 report you are ordering and your e - mail address to the
 person whose name appears on that list next to the report .
 make sure your return address is on your envelope top
 left corner in case of any mail problems .
 = = = when you place your order , make sure = = =
 = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = =
 you will need all 5 reports so that you can save
 them on your computer and resell them .
 your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 .
 within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each
 of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals .
 save them on your computer so they will be accessible
 for you to send to the 1 , 000 ' s of people who will
 order them from you . also make a floppy of these
 reports and keep it on your desk in case something
 happens to your computer .
 important - do not alter the names of the people who
 are listed next to each report , or their sequence on
 the list , in any way other than what is instructed
 below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
 on the majority of your profits . once you
 understand the way this works , you will also
 see how it will not work if you change it .
 remember , this method has been tested , and if you
 alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people have tried
 to put their friends ' / relatives ' names on all five
 thinking they could get all the money . but it does
 not work this way . believe us , some have tried to
 be greedy and then nothing happened . so do not
 try to change anything other than what is instructed .
 because if you do , it will not work for you .
 remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! !
 this is a legitimate business . you are offering a
 product for sale and getting paid for it . treat it
 as such and you will be very profitable in a short
 period of time .
 1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this
 advertisement and remove the name & address of the
 person in report # 5 . this person has made it through
 the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune .
 2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 .
 3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 .
 4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 .
 5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2
 6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position .
 please make sure you copy every name & address
 accurately ! this is critical to your success .
 * * * * take this entire letter , with the modified
 list of names , and save it on your computer .
 do not make any other changes .
 save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
 any data . to assist you with marketing your business
 on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will
 provide you with invaluable marketing information
 which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally ,
 where to find thousands of free classified ads and
 much more . there are 2 primary methods to get this
 venture going :
 method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally
 let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see
 how it goes , and we will assume you and those involved
 send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume
 that the mailing receives only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % )
 response ( the response could be much better but let ' s
 just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many people will send
 out hundreds of thousands of e - mails instead of only
 5 , 000 each .
 continuing with this example , you send out only
 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response , that is only
 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded
 by sending out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of
 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 %
 responded with orders . that ' s 100 people who
 responded and ordered report # 2 .
 those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for
 a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 % response to
 that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .
 those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mails each for a
 total of 5 million e - mails sent out . the 0 . 2 %
 response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 .
 those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each
 for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e - mails .
 the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for
 report # 5 .
 that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00
 ( half a million dollars ) .
 your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50
 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . . $ 50 , 000
 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . . grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00
 numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and
 figure out the worst possible responses and no
 matter how you calculate it , you will still
 make a lot of money !
 remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people
 ordering out of 5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think
 for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
 or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000
 e - mails each or more ?
 there are over 150 million people on the internet
 worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming
 online every day . believe me , many people will do
 just that , and more !
 method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet
 advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and
 there are hundreds of free places to advertise .
 placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
 easily get a larger response . we strongly suggest
 you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you
 go along . for every $ 5 you receive , all you must
 do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it .
 always provide same day service on all orders .
 this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out ,
 with your name and address on it , will be prompt
 because they cannot advertise until they receive
 the report .
 = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
 the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is
 illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply about time .
 time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
 approved , etc . concealing it is simply so no one
 can see there is money in the envelope and steal
 it before it gets to you .
 order each report by its number & name only .
 notes : always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for
 each report . checks not accepted . make sure the
 cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of
 paper , write the number & the name of the report
 you are ordering , your e - mail address and your
 name and postal address .

 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $
 follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :
 = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for
 report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue sending e - mails
 until you do .
 = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks
 after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
 report # 2 . if you do not , continue advertising or
 sending e - mails until you do .
 * * once you have received 100 or more orders for
 report # 2 , you can relax , because the system is
 already working for you , and the cash will continue
 to roll in ! this is important to remember : every time
 your name is moved down on the list , you are placed
 in front of a different report .
 you can keep track of your progress by watching which
 report people are ordering from you . if you want to
 generate more income send another batch of e - mails
 and start the whole process again . there is no limit
 to the income you can generate from this business ! ! !
 following is a note from the originator of this program :
 you have just received information that can give you
 financial freedom for the rest of your life , with
 no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can
 make more money in the next few weeks and months
 than you have ever imagined . follow the program
 exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way .
 it works exceedingly well as it is now .
 remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report
 after you have put your name and address in
 report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as
 instructed above . one of the people you send this
 to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your
 name will be on every one of them .
 remember though , the more you send out the more
 potential customers you will reach . so my friend ,
 i have given you the ideas , information , materials
 and opportunity to become financially independent .
 it is up to you now !

 my money back . i was surprised when i found my

 barry ,
 thanks for the timely email . i have your name on my list of people to
 contact this week as kevin hannon had mentioned to me just yesterday that our
 group might be able to help you in translating positions for the new risk
 system for ebs .
 you are right that i haven ' t been spending much time on 44 . martin lin has
 been taking the lead in day to day management of most of the current projects
 that we are supporting . we have been somewhat short handed since samer
 takriti left the group last fall and we were out - bid by mckinsey for cantekin
 dincerler who had helped us with ebs projects as an intern over the
 summer . however , we do have additional help coming . iris mack , a very
 bright new hire who comes with significant consulting and risk management
 experience , will be starting with the group next week . i am hoping that ,
 together with martin , she will allow us to significantly increase the
 research group presence on 44 and address areas which are currently
 undersupported .
 can i get on your schedule some time next week in order to map out the areas
 where we could best contribute to the risk management projects and to
 introduce iris and martin to you ? almost any time would be fine , or you can
 have your assistant coordinate with shirley crenshaw x 35290 .
 regards ,

 good news : i ' ve just received word that the ferc has issued an order denying
 socal ' s request for rehearing of the gallup order . ferc also ordered that
 tw ' s request for rehearing ( which asked the commission not to require tw to
 disclose discounted rates ) is now moot because we filed a discount report at
 the time required by section 284 . 7 ( b ) ( 6 ) of the commission ' s rules ( as we
 always do ) .
 if socal is still feeling vindictive , they can file an appeal in the d . c .
 circuit . i believe their window is 60 days . in any event , the pendency of
 an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate .
 if you have any questions , let me know ."

 subject : re : trip to houston
 stinson ,
 thank you for your e - mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .
 i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came
 straight to mit for a
 ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first
 three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,
 optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in
 psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,
 and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in
 particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and
 companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my
 phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am
 sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will
 give you an idea of what this research is about .
 thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research
 group next week .
 paulo
 pricing substitute products on the internet
 objective :
 to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold
 on
 the internet .
 motivation :
 this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and
 optimization
 models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological
 innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of
 information
 which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .
 furthermore ,
 companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can
 have access to .
 the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue
 faced
 by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .
 vcrs
 or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show
 different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of
 flexibility
 was not available until the internet came about .
 the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the
 methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of
 other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are
 many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a
 given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer
 to which customers and how much to charge for these services .
 research strategy :
 our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components
 which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these
 components are choice models and optimization models .
 choice models :
 choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature
 draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the
 common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic
 elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options
 based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice
 remains .
 these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very
 easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models
 that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological
 models .
 the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with
 these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how
 consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will
 be
 to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between
 customers
 and companies on the internet .
 optimization :
 traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a
 certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue
 still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term
 profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know
 your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must
 therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component
 ( learning ) ."

Sure if you're willing to risk firing, lawsuits, etc. The last full time 
job I had the sexual harassement seminar
was pretty clear - yes you can have relationships at the office, but its 
extremely difficult, and the pitfalls are
horrendous.Owen

 anita :
 i did some additional research regarding the sale to panenergy at meter 4045
 on 2 / 27 and 2 / 28 . this sale was a brokered deal .
 date purchase volume sale
 2 / 27 & 2 / 28 phillips gas mkt . ( # 55397 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
 ( # 64749 ) 10 . 000 mmbtu
 2 / 27 & 2 / 28 superior natural gas ( # 57065 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu panenergy marketing
 ( # 64749 ) 7 . 000 mmbtu
 ect did not transport this gas away from meter 4045 . if this gas was
 transported away from meter 4045 , it would have been a transaction between
 panenergy marketing ( or whomever they sold the gas to at that point ) and
 hpl . hope this information helps .

1,"Dear fellow eBay user,I listed this CD on eBay a few months ago and here's 
what happened.  I got an email from Safeharbor saying 
that all my auctions had been cancelled and that the CD 
was permanently ""banned"" from being sold on eBay.  From 
then on, I called it the ""Banned CD""!So why did eBay ban it?  Maybe they figured you shouldn't 
have access to this type of information, or maybe they 
didn't think we could cram all of these programs onto 
one CD Rom.  I'll let you decide.This CD will teach you things that eBay, Uncle Sam, and 
others just don't want you to know.  I am not responsible

0,"I rigged this up for testing before I commit to a sitewide rollout of
Spamassassin as an SMTP relay.
It is more work, but it avoids sitewide changes in mail delivery during the
early stages of testing.On the Exchange server... (mail.yourdomain.com)
Create a new, private SMTP address (nomorespam@yourdomain.com) for the
mailbox you want to protect. Remove the old address.Create a ""custom recipient"" with the old SMTP address
(spammedalot@yourdomain.com). Create another custom recipient pointing at a
local user on the Spamassassin box (killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com).Set the first custom recipient to forward all mail to the second custom
recipient. (must forward to another address in the Exchange directory)On the Spamassassin box... (filtermail.yourdomain.com)
Set up a dummy user, in this case ""killspam""
Give killspam a .forward file pointing to the final recipient's new, private
smtp address back on the Exchange server.So the message flow is like this:Mail arrives on the Exchange server mail.yourdomain.com for
spammedalot@yourdomain.comspammedalot@commonwealth.com forwards it to
killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.comFollowing the .forward file, the e-mail is then forwarded to
nomorespam@yourdomain.com
Wowie Zowie it works. The first address I protected was myself, the second
one I protected was postmaster.As you can see, you must create two custom recipients in Exchange and one
dummy account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address
you want to protect. Like I said, it is more work, but until I am done
load-testing, this is the way it will stay.-jake
